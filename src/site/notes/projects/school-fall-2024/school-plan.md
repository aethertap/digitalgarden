# School Planning Plan

I need some questions answered when I sit down to do a day's planning:

- What is the big-picture overview of where we're going? This should be where i start so I can answer the rest of these:

- What are the topics?
- What are the assignments?
- What needs to be graded?
- What areas do we need to work on more?
- What are we good at and can fast-track to the end?

## Fitting things together

- Writing should be done every day
    - **The [[projects/school-fall-2024/language/reading-journals\|reading-journals]]**
    - **Short-response questions about all subjects**
    - Long-form writing occasionally about particular subjects
    - **Writing work needs to be easier to turn in and grade**
- Math is self-contained and well-organized by the textbook already, no changes needed
    - The only problem is grading, but doing the grading on off-days with the kids seems to work pretty well. They get more benefit from it, and I get the grading done reliably.
- Physics/science: 
    - Physics needs an outline so that I can plan labs, assignments, and know what to teach.
    - I need to add experiments that fit with the topics
    - I need to add some crash-course level stuff for reviewing all of the basic concepts of scientific investigation and facts about the world
    - The lightning round needs to have a calculator so we can see the running score.
    - **I need to have consistent homework assignments with solveable problems.**
    - things need to be graded
- Engineering
    - **I need to develop the big-picture of where we're going with the projects**
    - We need to have a project plan with deadlines
    - We need to get the bots driving and following lines
- Programming
    - **We need to do a lot more small-exercises to work with basic code structures**
        - Use fill-in-the-blank scaffolded code exercises, where the main part of the code is already written, but important pieces are left as an exercise and clearly marked.
    - I need an outline of the simple skills we're going to build through the process. Maybe a published course can help here
- History
    - History is a train wreck, I need to add a LOT more outside material. Some of this can be part of the reading journal.
    - The kids need to be *writing* about their own analysis of the events of history.
    - I need to develop some reliable short-form prompts that I can drop in for any topic.
- Language/grammar
    - This is going well enough, but the rest of the BFLAN needs to be planned out in one big file so that I don't have to remember to do it every week.
    - Create due dates for each BFLAN topic.
