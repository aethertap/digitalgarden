## Demonstration

Attach a spring to the shaft of the drill and spin with a weight attached. 
- Measure angular speed
- Measure *force* on spring (distance)
- Change speed and repeat for a few speeds.

If the centripetal force is $mr\omega
{ #2}
$, what would happen to the surface of a bowl of water if you were to spin it at a fixed speed?
- Imagine there's a straw full of water, what happens to the pressure in it?
- It has the centripetal force for its distance, but it *also* has to support all of the other water closer to the center!
- The pressure goes up as the *square* of the radius, which means... so does the depth! 
- The surface of the water forms a perfect parabola! You can even use this to make a [liquid mirror telescope](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/liquid-mirror-telescopes).

## Concept summary and connections


- centripetal acceleration 
- centripetal force 

## Lesson content with examples

An object moving in a circle is always accelerating. After all, it's *velocity vector* is changing, so there must be acceleration happening. This is where we finally break the idea that *accelerating = going faster* once and for all! You can go in a circle without changing speed, forever. If the planets were it perfectly circular orbits, this is exactly what they would do (for some values of "forever" including "a really, really long time").

So how can that be? How can you *accelerate forever* without any energy going in to the system? How is it that your velocity can be constantly changing but your speed is constant? The answer to both is from one idea: 

**In circular motion, the acceleration always points toward the *center* of the rotation**

We know from geometry that that a line from the center of a circle is always perpendicular to the circle where it crosses. We also know that *work* only happens when some component of the motion is parallel to the force. Taking those together, we can see that the *centripetal force* doesn't do any work! It's always perpendicular to the object, so it doesn't change its kinetic energy.

### The math

Centripetal acceleration is inversely proportional to the radius of the arc, and directly proportional to the squared speed of the motion. The larger the arc, the lower the acceleration. The higher the speed, the higher the acceleration. $a_{c} = \frac{v^2}{r}$. We usually write this using angular velocity though:

$v=\omega r$, so $v^2 = \frac{\omega^2r^2}{r} = \omega^2 r$ 

So, we can write $a_c = \omega^2 r$, or centripetal acceleration is the angular velocity squared time the radius of the turn.

We also know that $\text{force}=\text{mass}\times \text{acceleration}$, so the centripetal *force* must be $f_{c}=m\omega^2r$

From that, we can figure out a whole bunch of neat stuff.

## Guided practice


- [ ] A tennis ball on a string, spinning. What happens when you double the length of the string?  
- [ ] What happens when you reel in the string so that it's 1/4 the length?  
- [ ] If you double the *speed* of the tennis ball, how much does the force on the string increase?  

## Homework



- [ ] #hw (physics) Brain teaser: IF $\text{work }=\text{force}\times\text{distance}$, and you tie a tennis ball to a string and spin it in space so it never stops, is the string doing work on the tennis ball? If so, where does the energy come from? [[2025-02-19\|2025-02-19]]
