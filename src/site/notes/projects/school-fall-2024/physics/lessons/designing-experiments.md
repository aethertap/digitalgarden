## Designing experiments: variables, controls, and models

Science is all about observing reality in order to build *models* for how things work. Most of the time, "how things work" means "what are the causes and effects that drive changes in this system?" We design experiments that **isolate** variables as much as possible, then measure and analyze the changes in order to build a set of rules called a **model**. The model allows us to **predict** what will happen in other cases that we didn't directly study, so it is useful for practical tasks in the real world. Models are not perfect, however, and they are always subject to improvements as we learn more about how the world works!

Designing experiments is a tricky art that's all about *making very specific properties measurable*. In real life, situations are almost always messy. There are dozens of different things happening at the same time, any or all of which might affect the results. In an experiment, we're trying to learn about specific relationships *in isolation*. How does one property of the system impact another?

In order to do this, we have to design very unnatural settings in which we keep as many things *constant* as we can, only changing one thing so that we can see how the other thing changes as a result. The thing we're controlling is called the *independent variable* in the experiment - we are directly controlling it so it doesn't *depend* on other things in the experiment. The things we're observing are called *dependent variables* because they (hopefully) depend on the thing we're messing with.

The easiest experiments have a very clearly defined independent variable, and a dependent variable that is easy to measure. We turn the knob and watch what changes, write it down, then think about it and try to come up with some kind of rule that can predict results in the future.

In real life, it's pretty hard to get things like this completely isolated. For one thing, many of the processes we investigate *naturally change over time* due to entropy. In cases like that, we want to have a *control* that we can compare our results with. A control is another instance of our experiment that's as close to identical to the main one as we can make it, but it differs in that we don't mess with the independent variable. For example, if we're measuring the effects of temperature on the mood of frogs, we'd want to have one tank of frogs held at a constant temperature while the other tank has its temperature varied. We'd then compare the two, based on the assumption that the passage of time will have the same overall effects on both tanks (hunger, sleepiness, light levels, all the stuff we have a harder time controlling directly).

Controls let you "ignore" messy dependencies between things when you can't hold them steady, so that you can get a better idea of what your intervention actually does.

### Designing an experiment

In order to design an experiment, you need to have a clear idea of what you're investigating. It's going to be a cause-effect relationship, in which the *cause* is a change in your independent variable, and the *effect* is the resulting change in the system. 

1. Design a setup that allows you to measure the effect accurately
2. Design a way to run multiple trials with different settings for your independent variable
3. Make a form or tool to record the data from each trial (including the control, if you have one)
4. After you have collected your data, analyze it to see if you can infer a relationship
5. That relationship becomes a *model*, which you can use to **predict results** for future trials.
6. Successfully predicting results for other configurations that weren't part of your original experiment acts as *validation* of your model.

## Guided practice

- [ ] If you have a fan-powered cart and some weights, how could you design an experiment to investigate the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration?  
- [ ] What trials would you run?  
- [ ] What would you use for independent variables and dependent variables?
- [ ] How could you control the independent variables in order to get usable data?

## Homework

- [ ] #hw (physics) Do the [Fan cart study](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/reasoning/newtonslaws/Fan-Cart-Study/) at physicsclassroom.com [[2025-02-14\|2025-02-14]]
- [ ] #hw Read [Investigating the browning process for fruit](https://www.snexplores.org/article/fresh-fruit-slices-turn-brown). Based on their experimental setup, what effects could they measure? What are the independent and dependent variables? What are the controls? In three sentences, summarize the experiment's design. [[2025-02-12\|2025-02-12]]
