## Guided practice


- [ ] What is the critical angle in the transition from water to air?  
- [ ] What is the critical angle in the transition from glass to water?  
- [ ] How can optical fibers bend light through such large angles?  
- [ ] If you are under water in a pool with your eyes 1 meter below the surface, how much of the pool's surface can you see through?
