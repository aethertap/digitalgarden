### Lightning Round Questions

- Why to ocean waves always crash inward toward the beach, even on a small island? 
- What would provide a greater impulse on impact: a 10 kg mass going 1 meter per second, or a 5 kg mass going 2 m/s? Which one has more kinetic energy? 
- You launch a rock from a slingshot straight upward at 98 m/s. How high will it go before it comes back down?

## Lesson content with examples


- Real images: When light rays from a point converge on a different point, a real image is formed. Real images will show up on a surface if it is placed at the point of convergence. 
- Virtual images: When there is a point that rays from a point on an object *seem* to come from, then a virtual image is formed. Nothing would show up on a surface there, but it appears to your eye as if there is something there.

## Guided practice


- [ ] You look into a mirror. Do you see a real image or a virtual image?  
- [ ] The projector shines like through lenses onto the whiteboard. Is it creating a real or virtual image?
