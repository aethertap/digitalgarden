## NotebookLM prompts

### Flashcard generation (work in progress, cards are too generic)

Please generate a set of flashcards to help me learn the material in **section number**. Each card front should appear only once. If a card has more than one possible answer, include all answers on the same card instead of making multiple cards for the same question. Please focus on understanding the mathematical relationships covered in the material, and on recognizing what the appropriate uses are for each relation. I would like to have 20 cards in JSON syntax, as an array of objects. Each object is one flashcard, and has a "front" and a "back" property whose value is the card's front or back text, respectively.

### Quiz generation

Please create a quiz with six questions that allows my students to practice their understanding of the ideas from chapter **chapter number**. The questions should require them to compute numerical answers, but the numbers should be small and easy to work with. Please focus on problems involving **topics**.

## Demonstration


## Concept summary and connections

- scaling vectors 
- add and subtract vectors 
- vector components 
- parallel and perpendicular decomp in X-Y plane
- vector magnitude 
- Placing a vector on the coordinate plane
- Parallel and Perpendicular to *inclined plane* or *other vector*
- Angles between vectors

## Worked examples

- Show what it means to scale a vector
- Show what happens to the components of a vector when it is scaled
- Do an example of graphical and analytical addition of scaled vectors.
