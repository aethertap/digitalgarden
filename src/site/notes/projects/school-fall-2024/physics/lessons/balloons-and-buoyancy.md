- What is the formula for the gravitational force of attraction between any two masses? 
- How do you access the command line arguments in a typescript program running on `node`? 
- What does it mean to *infer* something (especially in a science context)?

- What is the purpose of a pull-up or pull-down resistor? How does it work? 

## Demonstration


## Concept summary and connections


- floating and buoyancy 
- pressure, temperature, volume 
- pv=nrt 
- Ideal gas law 
- Absolute zero

$pv = nRt$

p = Pressure 
v = Volume
n = "amount of material" - usually constant for the problems we're doing
R = Boltzmann constant or ideal gas constant, 8.314 $\frac{J}{molÂ·K}$
t = temperature ***in kelvins*** (the **absolute temperature**) 

## Lesson content with examples

We know that temperature is just a statistical property of the energy of motion of the individual particles that make up a substance. In a gas, that motion also shows up as *pressure*.

### Remember temperature?

Temperature is just the way we measure the kinetic energy of the particles that are always rapidly vibrating in all matter. The faster they're moving, the hotter the temperature. But, how do we know that? The answer is that a lot of people did a lot of experiments in reality, but the thing that got us started was looking at the way gases behave as you change their temperatures. Here's the experiment:

1. Get a bunch of different gases and put them into a fixed size container with no leaks
2. Vary the temperature and measure the pressure for each gas at different temperatures
3. If you plot a line through the data for each gas, you'll get a bunch of lines that all cross at -273.15$\degree$ C, because that is the point at which all motion stops and pressure would therefore be zero!

Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature for matter, because temperature measures molecular motion, and all motion stops at zero. We can record this temperature in any scale you like:

- In Kelvins, absolute zero is just zero
- In Celsius, absolute zero is at -273.15$\degree$
- In Fahrenheit, absolute zero is at -459.67$\degree$

### What is pressure, exactly?

Imagine you have a 5 lb weight and you want to use it to make a hole in a board. If you set the weight on the board, it's not going to do the job. Now say you put the weight on the flat part of a thumb tack, do you think you'll have a different result? Why? In both cases, the weight is only putting 5 lbf on the board, so why should the thumb tack penetrate it easily while the weight stops? The answer is *pressure* - there is a lot more board in the way of the weight than there is in the way of the thumb tack, so the same amount of force is much more concentrated with the tack.  Pressure is a way to measure how much force is pushing *on a given area* rather than in total.

This shows up all the time when we're working with gases and liquids. We talk about the pressure in a pipe, the pressure in your veins, or the pressure of air in a tank. In every case, we're worried more about *force per area* than total force, because it's the force per area that makes things pop.

## Guided practice


- [ ] If a certain amount of gas is held at a constant pressure while you increase the temperature, what happens to its volume?  
- [ ] A hot-air balloon is hovering above the ground, supporting a 200 kg load of gondola basket and people. What is the difference in mass of the air in the balloon from a equal volume of air outside of the balloon?  
- [ ] How much weight could you place in a sealed liter bottle so that it would still float in water?
- [ ] If you have some air in a sealed container at 0$\degree$C, how hot would it be if you kept heating it until it *doubled its pressure*?

## Homework

- [ ] #hw (physics) Do the exercises in our lesson at [balloons-and-buoyancy](https://school.ginosterous.com/projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/balloons-and-buoyancy) [[2025-03-03\|2025-03-03]]
- [ ] #hw (physics) If a balloon holds 65000 cubit feet of air, and every 100 degree F increase in temperature decreases the density of a cubic foot by 7 grams, how hot does the air in the envelope need to be in order to lift 200 kg? 
- [ ] #hw (physics) How much water would a ship have to displace in order to carry 1000 metric tons of cargo? Water has a density of one gram per cubic centimeter. 
- [ ] #hw (physics) Add answers to *how*, *when*, and *what* to this sentence kernel to make a single, grammatically-correct sentence: "Things float by displacing fluid."
