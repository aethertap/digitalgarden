## Lesson content with examples


- focal length for curved mirrors 
- focal length for lenses 
- Magnification 
- object distance vs image distance 
- Thin lens equation 

### Magnification

There are two kinds of magnification we'll be looking at:
- Lateral magnification
- Angular magnification

Lateral magnification is the ratio of the *size* of the image to the size of the object. Angular magnification is the ratio of the *angle subtended by the image* to that of the object.

Magnification is a slightly misleading term - in common use, it means making something appear larger. In physics, it means simple making something appear with a *different size* - it could be smaller!

Compute magnification like this:
$$
\text{magnification} (m) =  -\frac{s'}{s}
$$
where $s'$ is the distance of the image from the lens, and $s$ is the distance of the object itself. 
- The **sign** of the result tells you whether the image is inverted or upright: negative results mean an inverted image
- The **magnitude** of the result tells you the relative size of the image: Multiply the size of the object by the magnification to get the size of the image.
- The **image distance** $s'$ is defined to be a ***negative number*** for a **virtual** image, and postive for a real image.


### Thin Lens Equation

This is the *thin lens equation* - it lets you compute the **object distance** ($s$), the **image distance** ($s'$) or the **focal length** $f$ of a lens if you know the other two:

$$
\frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s'} = \frac{1}{f}
$$


The focal length of a thin lens can be computed if you know the index of refraction (n) and the radius of each side of the lens ($R_{1}, R_{2}$):

$$
\frac{1}{f} = (n-1)\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right)
$$

All of the terms have *sign conventions* that tell you when the term should be positive or negative depending on the situation:

| Term          | Positive when                          | Negative When                         |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| $R_{1},R_{2}$ | Convex toward the object               | Concave toward the object             |
| f             | Converging lens, thicker in the center | Diverging lens, thinner at the center |
| $s'$          | Real image, opposite side from object  | Virtual image, same side as object    |

### Curved mirrors

The mirror equation for curved mirrors is identical to the thin lens equation!
$$
\frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s'} = \frac{1}{f}
$$

Mirrors can also make real or virtual images. In a concave mirror, a real image is made on the *same side* of the mirror as the object. In a convex mirror, a *virtual* image is made on the *opposite* side of the mirror from the object.

### Examples

- What is the focal length of a *meniscus lens* (a lens with curves that bend in the same direction) where $R_{1}=40cm$ and $R_{2}=20cm$?
- A magnifying lens is 2.0 cm above a stamp. The magnification is 4.0. What is the focal length of the lens?
- Let's compute the focal lengths of our magnifying glasses. How could we do that?

## Guided practice


- [ ] A 4.0 cm diameter flower is 200 cm from the 50 cm focal length lens of a camera. How far should the light detector be placed behind the lens to record a well-focused image? What is the diameter of the image on the detector?  
- [ ] You are holding a magnifying lens with a 6.0 cm focal length 4.0 cm above a flower in order to magnify it. What is the magnification?  

## Homework

1. What is the magnification when you use a lens with 8 cm focal length to view something at a distance of 7 cm? [[2025-04-09\|2025-04-09]]
2. should you move the lens closer or farther from the object if you want to increase the magnification? [[2025-04-09\|2025-04-09]]
3. What happens to the image you see if you move the lens *past* the focal point? [[2025-04-09\|2025-04-09]]
