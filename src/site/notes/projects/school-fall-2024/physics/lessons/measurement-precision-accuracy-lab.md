## NotebookLM prompts

### Flashcard generation (work in progress, cards are too generic)

Please generate a set of flashcards to help me learn the material in **section number**. Each card front should appear only once. If a card has more than one possible answer, include all answers on the same card instead of making multiple cards for the same question. Please focus on understanding the mathematical relationships covered in the material, and on recognizing what the appropriate uses are for each relation. I would like to have 20 cards in JSON syntax, as an array of objects. Each object is one flashcard, and has a "front" and a "back" property whose value is the card's front or back text, respectively.

### Quiz generation

Please create a quiz with six questions that allows my students to practice their understanding of the ideas from chapter **chapter number**. The questions should require them to compute numerical answers, but the numbers should be small and easy to work with. Please focus on problems involving **topics**.

## Lab setup

### Measuring volume with displacement

- Graduated cylinder
    - Metal d6
    - metal d4
    - glass marble
- dense objects to check
- Volume of sphere $\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$
- Volume of cube $l^3$
- Volume of tetrahedron $\frac{l^3}{6 \sqrt{ 2 }}$

Procedure:
1. Compute the volume of each object with the formula
2. Measure the volume with displacement method, 5 measurements each
3. Compare results

### Measuring distance

- Measure three of my setup blocks, in cm
- Use ruler, meter stick, and calipers
- Compare to exact known value.
- One inch is *exactly* 2.54 cm by definition
