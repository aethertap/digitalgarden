### Lightning Round Questions

- #quiz What is the formula for *centripetal acceleration*? $a_c = \omega^2r$ 
- An object collides with an identical, but stationary object in space. They stick together as they move after the collision. How fast is the combined object going compared to the speed of the first object? 
- Evaluate $3 \frac{1}{2}\cdot 4 \frac{3}{5}$ 
- What is the magnitude of the vector $12\hat{i}+4\hat{j}$? 
- How do you make a new instance of a class in typescript? 
- Give an example of an equation with no solutions.

## Lesson content with examples

We're just going to do some problem-solving today. Here are the formulas we'll need:

- Centripetal Acceleration: $a_c = \omega
{ #2r}
$
- Centripetal Force: $f_{c} = m\omega^2r$
- Kinetic energy: $e_{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- Potential energy (gravitational): $e_{g}=mgh$
- Momentum: $I=mv$
- Work ($\vec{d}$ is displacement): $w=\vec{f}\cdot  \vec{d}$ 
- Impulse ($t$ is time): $I=t\vec{f}$

## Guided practice


- [ ] How fast would you have to drive if you wanted to use a hilltop with radius 20 m as a ramp (so your car leaves the ground)?  
- [ ] How fast would you have to drive to make it around a vertical loop of radius 30 m without losing contact with the road?  

## Homework

- [x] #hw Work on the physics assignment that's due Friday! **Don't wait** [[2025-02-24\|2025-02-24]]
