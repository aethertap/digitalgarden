## Guided practice


- [ ] Design an experiment to determine whether the distance of stretching changes the oscillation period of a weight bouncing on a spring.  

## Homework

- [ ] #hw (physics) Write up the results of your spring experiment as a formal lab report (use [this link as a guide](https://www.aplusphysics.com/courses/regents/lab_report.html)), and explain your conclusions. [[2025-04-14\|2025-04-14]]
