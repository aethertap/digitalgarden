## NotebookLM prompts

### Flashcard generation (work in progress, cards are too generic)

Please generate a set of flashcards to help me learn the material in **section number**. Each card front should appear only once. If a card has more than one possible answer, include all answers on the same card instead of making multiple cards for the same question. Please focus on understanding the mathematical relationships covered in the material, and on recognizing what the appropriate uses are for each relation. I would like to have 20 cards in JSON syntax, as an array of objects. Each object is one flashcard, and has a "front" and a "back" property whose value is the card's front or back text, respectively.

### Quiz generation

Please create a quiz with six questions that allows my students to practice their understanding of the ideas from chapter **chapter number**. The questions should require them to compute numerical answers, but the numbers should be small and easy to work with. Please focus on problems involving **topics**.

### Lightning Round Questions

- What is an *intensive property* (chemistry)? 
- What is a *control* in an experiment? Why is it important? 
- [ ] #quiz If the surface of the moon is covered in fine, sandy material, why are there no dunes on the moon?

    - Which forces do you draw? They come in pairs...
    - Draw *only the forces that **act on the body***
    - e.g. in a rocket, the thrust acting on it will push it forward. You don't draw the force that the rocket exerts on the burnt fuel as it gets propelled out the back!

- vector addition 
- summing integration 
## Worked examples

- A car driving a constant speed crests a hill. Is it accelerating? Draw a motion diagram to answer.
- A spaceship makes a soft landing on Mars. Draw a motion diagram and a pictorial representation.

## Guided practice


- [ ] A book is at rest on a tabletop. Diagram the forces acting on the book. See answer.  
- [ ] A gymnast holding onto a bar, is suspended motionless in mid-air. The bar is supported by two ropes that attach to the ceiling. Diagram the forces acting on the combination of gymnast and bar. See answer.  
- [ ] A rightward force is applied to a book in order to move it across a desk at constant velocity. Consider frictional forces. Neglect air resistance. Diagram the forces acting on the book  
- [ ] You drop a soccer ball from a second-story window. Draw a *motion diagram* that shows the ball's position, velocity, and acceleration from the instant you release it until the instant it touches the ground.
