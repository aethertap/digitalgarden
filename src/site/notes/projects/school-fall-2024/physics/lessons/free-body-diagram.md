## NotebookLM prompts

### Flashcard generation (work in progress, cards are too generic)

Please generate a set of flashcards to help me learn the material in **section number**. Each card front should appear only once. If a card has more than one possible answer, include all answers on the same card instead of making multiple cards for the same question. Please focus on understanding the mathematical relationships covered in the material, and on recognizing what the appropriate uses are for each relation. I would like to have 20 cards in JSON syntax, as an array of objects. Each object is one flashcard, and has a "front" and a "back" property whose value is the card's front or back text, respectively.

### Quiz generation

Please create a quiz with six questions that allows my students to practice their understanding of the ideas from chapter **chapter number**. The questions should require them to compute numerical answers, but the numbers should be small and easy to work with. Please focus on problems involving **topics**.

### Lightning Round Questions

- Give an example of an equation with no solutions. 
- What is a *bias*? 
- What is the formula for kinetic energy of a moving mass? 
- Explain what impulse is. 

## Demonstration


- Solve for the maximum angle that a book on a tilted board can remain at rest before the sliding force overcomes the friction force.
- Use that concept to solve for the coefficient of friction

## Concept summary and connections


- free-body diagrams 
- balancing forces 
- external force 
- net external force 
- force vs tension

## Guided practice

Do a full example of the [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/physics-homework-problem-template\|physics-homework-problem-template]] for each of these on the whiteboard in class.

- [ ] Draw an FBD for a book sitting on a level table. 
    - [ ] The book has a mass of 1 kg, Solve the FBD for all forces.
- [ ] Draw an FBD for a book at rest on a sloped surface.
    - [ ] The book has a mass of 1 kg, and the slope is 30$\degree$, what friction force is required to keep the book from moving?
- [ ] Draw an FBD for a parachutist falling steadily through the air.
- [ ] Draw an FBD for a car driving up a hill at a constant speed (ignore wind resistance for now).
    - [ ] The hill has a 10$\degree$ slope and the car has a mass of 500 kg, solve the FBD.

## Homework

- [ ] #hw (physics) A 1000-kg car is rolling slowly backward down a hill with 10$\degree$ slope. Draw a free body diagram to analyze the car's motion, and label all forces (ignore friction and wind resistance). [[2025-01-22\|2025-01-22]] 
- [ ] #hw (physics) Solve the FBD using the [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/physics-homework-problem-template\|physics-homework-problem-template]] we demonstrated in class [[2025-01-22\|2025-01-22]]
- [ ] #hw (physics) Now you run up to the car and start pushing against the bumper to try to stop it. How hard would you have to push in order to eventually stop the car? Does that seem like something a normal person could manage? [[2025-01-22\|2025-01-22]]
