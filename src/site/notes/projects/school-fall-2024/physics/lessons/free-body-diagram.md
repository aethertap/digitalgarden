### Lightning Round Questions

- Give an example of an equation with no solutions. 
- What is a *bias*? 
- What is the formula for kinetic energy of a moving mass? 
- Explain what impulse is. 

## Demonstration


- Solve for the maximum angle that a book on a tilted board can remain at rest before the sliding force overcomes the friction force.
- Use that concept to solve for the coefficient of friction

## Concept summary and connections

A Free-body diagram is a tool that we use to simplify the forces acting on something so that we can see what will happen to it. Here's how it works:

1. Draw a simple representation of the object (a small box, a dot, a circle, something like that)
2. For each ***external force acting on the object***, draw a vector that shows the direction and approximate magnitude of the force. It doesn't need to be a precise diagram, it's just a representation so that you can have places to hang your math to keep it organized.
3. Use the diagram to figure out what the ***resultant force*** is, and from there you can answer a lot of questions.
    1. The ***Resultant force*** is a single force that will have the same effect as all of the forces from the diagram. Since forces are vector quantities, you can find the resultant force by adding up other forces. 
    2. The resultant force can tell you in which direction the object will accelerate, and what the acceleration will be (as long as you know the inertia anyway).
    3. You can also **decompose** the resultant force into other forces that are parallel and perpendicular to various things, which is helpful when you need to know something like how much tension is in a rope that's keeping a car from rolling down a hill.

## Guided practice

Do a full example of the [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/physics-homework-problem-template\|physics-homework-problem-template]] for each of these on the whiteboard in class.

- [ ] Draw an FBD for a book sitting on a level table. 
    - [ ] The book has a mass of 1 kg, Solve the FBD for all forces.
- [ ] Draw an FBD for a book at rest on a sloped surface.
    - [ ] The book has a mass of 1 kg, and the slope is 30$\degree$, what friction force is required to keep the book from moving?
- [ ] Draw an FBD for a parachutist falling steadily through the air.
- [ ] Draw an FBD for a car driving up a hill at a constant speed (ignore wind resistance for now).
    - [ ] The hill has a 10$\degree$ slope and the car has a mass of 500 kg, solve the FBD.

## Homework

- [x] #hw (physics) A 1000-kg car is rolling slowly backward down a hill with 10$\degree$ slope. Draw a free body diagram to analyze the car's motion, and label all forces (ignore friction and wind resistance). [[2025-01-24\|2025-01-24]]
- [x] #hw (physics) Solve the FBD using the [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/physics-homework-problem-template\|physics-homework-problem-template]] we demonstrated in class [[2025-01-24\|2025-01-24]]
- [x] #hw (physics) Now you run up to the car and start pushing against the bumper to try to stop it. How hard would you have to push in order to eventually stop the car? Does that seem like something a normal person could manage? [[2025-01-24\|2025-01-24]]
