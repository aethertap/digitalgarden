## Lesson content with examples

Today, we're setting our course for the rest of the school year.

## Guided practice

- [ ] Survey the physics text and prioritize the remainder by interest.  

### Results:

1. Optics (ch. 34 - Ray Optics) and electromagnetics (Ch. 29-31 - magnetic fields, electromagnetic induction, electromagnetic fields)
2. Nuclear physics
3. Vortex cannons and fluid movement
4. Resonance
