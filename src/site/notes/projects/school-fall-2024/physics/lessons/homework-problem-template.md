# Physics homework problem answer template

We're going to build up a habit of showing complete work by using a template for all of our physics kinematics work from now on. It has four parts:

1. A [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/pictorial-representation\|pictorial-representation]] of the problem
2. A [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/motion-diagram\|motion-diagram]] showing the vector velocities and accelerations, or a [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/free-body-diagram\|free-body-diagram]] showing the external forces if appropriate
3. A table of values and variable definitions
4. A solution that has the math worked through and relevant physical laws and properties called out next to the steps where they are used.
