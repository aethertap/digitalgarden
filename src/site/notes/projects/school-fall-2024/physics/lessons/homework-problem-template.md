# Physics homework problem answer template

We're going to build up a habit of showing complete work by using a template for all of our physics kinematics work from now on. It has four parts:

1. A [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/pictorial-representation\|pictorial-representation]] of the problem
2. Either (or both, if it makes sense): 
    1. A [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/motion-diagram\|motion-diagram]] showing the velocities and accelerations;
    2. or a [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/free-body-diagram\|free-body-diagram]] showing the external forces if appropriate
3. A table of values and variable definitions used in the kinematic equations section
4. A solution that uses labeled kinematic equations to find the desired answer. Use the [[projects/school-fall-2024/geometry/lessons/two-column-proofs\|two-column-proofs]] format.
