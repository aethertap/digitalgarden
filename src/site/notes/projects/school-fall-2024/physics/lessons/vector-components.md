## NotebookLM prompts

### Flashcard generation (work in progress, cards are too generic)

Please generate a set of flashcards to help me learn the material in **section number**. Each card front should appear only once. If a card has more than one possible answer, include all answers on the same card instead of making multiple cards for the same question. Please focus on understanding the mathematical relationships covered in the material, and on recognizing what the appropriate uses are for each relation. I would like to have 20 cards in JSON syntax, as an array of objects. Each object is one flashcard, and has a "front" and a "back" property whose value is the card's front or back text, respectively.

### Quiz generation

Please create a quiz with six questions that allows my students to practice their understanding of the ideas from chapter **chapter number**. The questions should require them to compute numerical answers, but the numbers should be small and easy to work with. Please focus on problems involving **topics**.

## Demonstration

- Add two horizontal vectors, vertical vectors
- Add two 2d vectors graphically
- Draw a vector in quadrant 1 and break it into axis-parallel components
- move it to Q2 and ask them to find components, then Q-3 then Q4
    - **components are always the same**
## Concept summary and connections


- vector components 
- vector addition 
- component addition 
- vector graphical addition 
- decomposing vectors

## Guided practice

This is the meat of the class, do *several* of each of these as on-the-board challenges. Vary the positions, orientations, and sizes of the vectors involved. 

- [ ] add graphically
- [ ] add by components  
- [ ] subtract graphically  
- [ ] subtract by components  
- [ ] find components in any quadrant
