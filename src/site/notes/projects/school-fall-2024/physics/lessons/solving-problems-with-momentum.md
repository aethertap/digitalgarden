### Lightning Round Questions

- Draw a circuit that uses a pull-down resistor to determine whether a switch is closed or open. 
- What is PWM and what are some common uses for it? 
- If the surface of the moon is covered in fine, sandy material, why are there no dunes on the moon? 
- What is the magnitude of the vector $12\hat{i}+4\hat{j}$? 
- What does the `map` function do on an array? 


## Demonstration


## Concept summary and connections


- momentum 
- mass * velocity 
- Momentum transfers 
- Contact forces, impulse is force times time 
- conservation of momentum 
- sum of all momenta before must equal sum of all after 

## Lesson content with examples

Momentum is the tendency of an object to continue doing what it's doing. Mass and velocity contribute equally.

Momentum is a vector quantity, because it's a scalar (mass) times a vector (velocity).

## Guided practice


- [ ] The red billiard ball hits the blue ball in the orientation shown. Which direction is the impulse that's applied to the blue ball? Which direction is the impulse for the red ball?  
- [ ] The exhaust gas from a rocket leaves at a velocity of 25,000 meters per second. How much fuel will the rocket need to burn in order to accelerate to 1000 meters per second if its mass is 500 kg.
