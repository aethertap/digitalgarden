## Guided practice


- [ ] Earth's radius is 6371 km. A satellite in low-earth orbit moves at 28,000 km/h. Assuming that the acceleration due to gravity is the same, what is the satellite's altitude above ground?  
- [ ] You are designing a long-term space station and want some artificial gravity.  There's a problem though, the "cross-coupled illusion" makes people motion sick if they're spinning above about 5 rpm. How big does your spinning station need to be to provide one-g of gravity without going faster than 10 rpm?
