### Lightning Round Questions

- What was the Meiji restoration? (A rapid Japanese move to industrialize in order to protect their culture) 
- Draw a right triangle and label one of the right angles as $\theta$. Which two sides make the ratio called $\cos \theta$? 
- Make a bar graph showing 25 pigeons, 10 squirrels, 7 earthworms, and 14 beetles, as if it was information from an ecological survey. 
- Draw a circuit with a voltage divider. 
- What is the SI prefix for *hundredth*? 
- What is absolute zero in degrees Celsius?

## Guided practice


- [ ] If a gas is free to expand or contract without changing its pressure, what happens to its volume if its temperature is doubled?  
- [ ] How much force would a pressure of 15 psi exert on a one foot square window of a spacecraft operating in vacuum?  
- [ ] What causes our atmosphere to have the level of pressure it has?  
- [ ] Discuss the problems from last time - how did you approach them?
