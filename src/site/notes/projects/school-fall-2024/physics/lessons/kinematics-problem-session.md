### Kinematic Equations Recap

These equations will get you a long way toward finding the solution for most problems with constant acceleration:

$x = \frac{1}{2} at^2+v_{0}t+x_{0}$
$v = at+v_{0}t$

| variable | interpretation                                                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $x$      | position, or displacement from whatever your starting point is                           |
| $t$      | Time since the start of the period of time we're working with                            |
| $v$      | Velocity at the current moment (determined by your choice of a value for $t$             |
| $v_{0}$  | The *initial velocity* (velocity we had going into the problem)                          |
| $x_{0}$  | The *initial position* (location relative to our zero point at the start of the problem) |

Notice that position is always a parabolic curve if you have constant acceleration (even if the acceleration is in the opposite direction of the initial velocity). With constant acceleration, velocity changes *linearly*.

***BE CAREFUL:*** there are many situations in which **acceleration is not constant**. These equations will not work if the acceleration changes during the time covered by the equation. You can still use them, but only if you can break the time segments into pieces in which the acceleration **is** constant. Otherwise, you're going to need more math powertools (calculus).

### Problem-solving tips

- If you need to know the *maximum (or minimum) position*, that means that the object *reversed direction* at that same moment (otherwise, it wouldn't be the max because it kept going even farther...). When it reverses direction, the sign of its velocity has to change, and *that* means that its velocity was zero **in the direction of the acceleration** at that moment. You can find that moment by solving the *velocity* equation for the time when it's zero, and then use the result to calculate what the position was at that time.
- The acceleration at any moment is always equal to the *slope* of the velocity graph at that moment
- The velocity at any moment is always equal to the *slope* of the position graph at that moment
- *Average velocity* is often useful in problems with *constant acceleration*, because you can use it to calculate distance traveled without using the full kinematic equation

- [ ] find the vector magnitude of $5\hat{i}-12\hat{j}+13\hat{k}$
- [ ] How far will a rock fall in 10 seconds if dropped in Earth's gravity?  
- [ ] How high will a bullet go if shot straight up at an initial velocity of 1000 ft/sec?  
- [ ] How far does a frog leap if it extends its legs by 15 cm during a 65 ms pushoff at a 30$\degree$ angle?  
- [ ] A plane is flying at 500 mph in a due-east heading, but the pilot doesn't know that there is a 50 mph wind blowing to the south. What is the plane's actual ground speed? If the plane flies for 36 minutes, how far south of its expected position will it actually end up?  

## Homework

- [ ] #hw (physics) In the plane problem we did in class ([click here to see the question](https://school.ginosterous.com/projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/kinematics-problem-session)), in what direction should the pilot orient the plane in order to compensate for the wind and end up at his desired location? Give the direction as an angle from due east. [[2025-02-05\|2025-02-05]] 
- [ ] #hw (physics) A ball thrown horizontally at 25 m/s travels a horizontal distance of 50m before hitting the ground. How high was it above the ground when it was thrown? [[2025-02-05\|2025-02-05]]
- [ ] #hw (physics) A rifle is fired horizontally at a target 50m away. The bullet hits the target 2.0 cm below the aim point. What was the bullet's **flight time**? What was the bullet's **speed** just as it left the barrel?
