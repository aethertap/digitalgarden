### Lightning Round Questions

- Explain the concept of Inertia 
- How would you tell an Arduino to output a PWM signal of 50% duty cycle on PWM pin 9? 
- A bowl of water sitting on a scale reads 1 kg. You submerge an object hanging from a string, so that it doesn't touch the bottom of the dish. The scale now reads 1300 grams. What is the *volume* of the object? 
- What is the formula for kinetic energy of a moving mass? 
- What is the SI unit equivalent to a Newton? 
- How many cubic centimeters are in a liter?

## Homework



- [x] #hw (physics) ACE Response: "Being challenged is important for kids' development." Consider the statement and argue for or against it, using any article you want for evidence. [[2025-04-21\|2025-04-21]]
- [x] #hw (physics) Think about how to extend the flat-object center of mass procedure we used into one that works for a three-dimensional object. Write your procedure with clear steps. What is the smallest number of measurements you would need in order to mark the center of mass of a three-dimensional object? [[2025-04-16\|2025-04-16]]
