### Lightning Round Questions

- (lang) need to practice recognizing prepositions. 
- Design a voltage divider that will give you 3.5v from a 5v source. 
- When is this expression undefined: $\frac{x+7}{x-2}$? 
- If you drop a brick from the first story window, it hits the ground with a certain speed. How much higher would you have to drop from in order to double the *speed* at the moment of impact? 
- What are the basic steps of scientific inquiry?

- gravity, spring force are conservative 
- friction, air resistance, others are non-conservative 

## Lesson content with examples

What are conservative vs non-conservative forces? A conservative force is one that does the same amount of *work* ***no matter what path was taken***. It only depends on the *displacement* of the object in question. Example: Gravity. Your potential energy only depends on your height, it doesn't matter whether you take a wild ride to the bottom of fall in a straight line, if gravity is the only force, then you'll have the same kinetic energy at the end no matter how you get there. This is how roller coasters work, except that they have to deal with....

**Friction**, which is a non-conservative force. The amount of work done by friction depends on how long the path was - the longer the path, the more time friction has to act on you, and the more work it does to slow you down. If it wasn't for friction, a roller coaster could keep going forever. However, friction is everywhere. That's why a coaster has to have the lifter tracks on the uphill sections to get you back up to the full height of the ride - without those, it would be stuck going over rapidly-shrinking hills because it's energy is being drained any time it's moving.

### Systems

Any time you have a system with *conservative* forces, the energy stays in the system and merely changes form. However, when you have any non-conservative forces in play, energy can enter or leave the system. Most of the time, it's leaving in the form of unrecoverable heat and noise vibrations caused by friction.

When you're making LOL diagrams to represent energy movement at different intervals, the non-conservative forces are the only ones that breach the system boundary.

## Guided practice


- [ ] Draw energy chart for friction-free roller coaster at different points along the track.  
- [ ] Now add friction and air-resistance, and draw the charts again.
