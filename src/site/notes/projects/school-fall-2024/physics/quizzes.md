# Physics quizzes (weekly)

- [ ] Physics quiz [[2025-01-07\|2025-01-07]]

1. What physical property does a spring scale actually measure when you step onto the platform? Why would this probably be different on a different planet?
2. What is the name of the position a spring is in when it is not being deformed by stretching or compression?
3. What is Hooke's Law? Give the formula and explain what it means.
4. You stretch a spring 4 cm and record a tension of 100N. What is the spring constant for this spring? *Make sure you include units*
5. What is the name of the force that a spring exerts to get back to its equilibrium position?
6. What does the term *centripetal force* mean, and what kind of motion does it help us describe?
7. What is the formula for centripetal force, both in terms of speed and of angular speed?
8. A satellite in *geostationary orbit* will orbit at a speed that keeps it above the same point on earth at all times. The distance to the center of the earth at this height is about 39,000 km. The acceleration due to gravity is only $0.224  {m\over s^2}$ because it is so far above the surface. What is the satellite's centripetal acceleration in this orbit? How fast must it be moving?
9. When you first let go of a bowling ball, it‚Äôs not rotating. But as it slides down the alley, it begins to rotate. Use the concept of energy to explain why the ball‚Äôs forward speed decreases as it begins to spin.
10. You want to drop a 1 kg weight onto a nail in order to drive it into a block of wood. On your first try, you drop it from a height of 1 meter but the nail only goes in 1 cm. If you start with a new nail, from how high would you need to drop the weight in order to drive it 4 cm deep? How much faster would the weight be moving when it hit from this new height?
11. If you throw a ball upward at a velocity of 64 ft/s, how long will it take for it to reach its highest point? How high will it be at that time?

## Momentum and Energy

Here is a six-question quiz about momentum and energy, drawing on information from chapters 1-3 of the source:

- **Question 1:** A pitcher throws a 0.5 kg baseball at 10 m/s. What is the baseball's momentum?
    - **Answer:** Momentum is the product of mass and velocity: 0.5 kg * 10 m/s = **5 kg*m/s**
- **Question 2:** A 2-kg bowling ball is moving at 4 m/s. How much kinetic energy does it have?
    - **Answer:** Kinetic energy is found using the equation: 1/2 * mass * speed^2. So, the bowling ball has 1/2 * 2 kg * (4 m/s)^2 = **16 J** of kinetic energy.
- **Question 3:** A 1-kg cart is rolling at 2 m/s. It collides with a stationary 1-kg cart and they stick together. How fast are the two carts moving after the collision?
    - **Answer:** Momentum is conserved in a collision. The momentum before the collision is 1 kg * 2 m/s = 2 kg m/s. After the collision, the combined mass is 2 kg, and the momentum is still 2 kg m/s. Therefore, the velocity is 2 kg m/s / 2 kg = **1 m/s**.
- **Question 4:** You drop a 1-kg rock from a height of 2 meters. What is its velocity just before it hits the ground?
    - **Answer:** Neglecting air resistance, the rock's gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The potential energy is mass * acceleration due to gravity * height = 1 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 2 m = 19.6 J. This becomes the kinetic energy just before impact. Using the kinetic energy formula (1/2 * mass * speed^2 = 19.6 J), and solving for speed, we get speed = (2*19.6 J / 1 kg)^1/2 = **6.26 m/s**.
- **Question 5:** A 0.1 kg tennis ball is traveling at 20 m/s. A tennis racket hits the ball and sends it back in the opposite direction at 30 m/s. What is the magnitude of the impulse delivered to the ball?
    - **Answer:** The magnitude of the impulse is equal to the change in momentum of the tennis ball. Initially, the ball's momentum is 0.1 kg * 20 m/s = 2 kg*m/s. After being hit, its momentum is 0.1 kg * (-30 m/s) = -3 kg*m/s (note the negative sign for the change in direction). The change in momentum, and therefore the magnitude of the impulse, is 2 kg*m/s - (-3 kg*m/s) = **5 kg*m/s**.
- **Question 6:** A child pushes a 5-kg sled across frictionless ice with a force of 10 N for a distance of 2 m. How much work did the child do on the sled?
    - **Answer:** The work done is equal to the force applied times the distance over which the force is applied. In this case, the work is 10 N * 2 m = **20 J**.

## Rotation

Here is a six-question quiz about **torque, rotational energy, angular momentum, rolling, and rotation**, drawing on information from chapter 2 of the source:

- **Question 1:** A mechanic applies a force of 5 N to a wrench that is 0.2 m long. What is the torque applied to the bolt?
    
    - **Answer:** Torque is the product of the force and the lever arm. So the torque is 5 N * 0.2 m = **1 N*m**.
- **Question 2:** A 1-kg solid disk with a radius of 0.1 m is rotating at 2 radians per second. What is its rotational kinetic energy?
    
    - **Answer:** A solid disk has a rotational mass of 1/2 * mass * radius^2 = 1/2 * 1 kg * (0.1 m)^2 = 0.005 kg*m^2. The rotational kinetic energy is 1/2 * rotational mass * angular speed^2 = 1/2 * 0.005 kg*m^2 * (2 rad/s)^2 = **0.01 J**.
- **Question 3:** A figure skater has an initial angular momentum of 10 kg*m^2/s. She pulls her arms in, reducing her rotational mass to half its original value. What is her new angular speed?
    
    - **Answer:** Angular momentum is conserved. Initially, her angular momentum is 10 kg*m^2/s. After pulling her arms in, her angular momentum is still 10 kg*m^2/s, but her rotational mass is halved. Therefore, her angular velocity must double to 10 kg*m^2/s / (1/2 * original rotational mass) = **2 * original angular velocity**.
- **Question 4:** A bicycle wheel with a radius of 0.3 m is rolling without slipping at a speed of 2 m/s. What is its angular speed?
    
    - **Answer:** For an object rolling without slipping, its speed is the product of its angular speed and its radius. Therefore, the angular speed of the wheel is 2 m/s / 0.3 m = **6.67 rad/s**.
- **Question 5:** You apply a torque of 2 N*m to a flywheel for 5 seconds. What is the angular impulse you delivered to the flywheel?
    
    - **Answer:** Angular impulse is the product of torque and the time interval over which it acts. So the angular impulse is 2 N*m * 5 s = **10 N*m*s**.
- **Question 6:** A ball is rolling down an inclined plane. As it rolls down the plane, does its angular momentum about its center of mass increase, decrease, or stay the same?
    
    - **Answer:** Assuming no frictional losses, the ball's angular momentum about its center of mass **stays the same**. While gravity exerts a torque on the ball that would change its angular momentum, the contact point between the ball and the ramp exerts an equal and opposite torque, preventing a change in angular momentum.

## Springs and Centripetal force

Here is a six-question quiz about **centripetal force and acceleration, and Hooke's law**, drawing on information from chapter 3 of the source:

- **Question 1:** A 0.1-kg ball on a string is swung in a circle with a radius of 0.5 m at a speed of 2 m/s. What is the tension in the string?
    
    - **Answer:** The tension in the string provides the centripetal force. The centripetal force is equal to the mass times the centripetal acceleration. The centripetal acceleration is speed^2 / radius. Therefore, the tension is 0.1 kg * (2 m/s)^2 / 0.5 m = **0.8 N**.
- **Question 2:** A child is riding on a merry-go-round with a radius of 2 m. The merry-go-round is spinning at a rate of 1 revolution per 4 seconds. What is the child's centripetal acceleration?
    
    - **Answer:** One revolution per 4 seconds is an angular velocity of 2ùúã radians / 4 s = ùúã/2 rad/s. The centripetal acceleration is equal to the angular velocity squared times the radius: (ùúã/2 rad/s)^2 * 2 m = **4.93 m/s^2**.
- **Question 3**: A spring has a spring constant of 10 N/m. How much force is required to stretch the spring by 0.2 m?
    
    - **Answer**: Hooke's law states that the restoring force is equal to the spring constant times the distortion. Therefore, the force required is 10 N/m * 0.2 m = **2 N**.
- **Question 4:** You hang a 2-kg weight from a spring scale. The spring stretches 0.1 m. What is the spring constant of the spring scale?
    
    - **Answer:** The weight exerts a force of 2 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 19.6 N on the spring. According to Hooke's law, the spring constant is the force divided by the distortion: 19.6 N / 0.1 m = **196 N/m**.
- **Question 5:** An astronaut on a spinning space station experiences an apparent weight equal to her weight on Earth. If the space station has a radius of 50 m, how long does it take to complete one rotation?
    
    - **Answer:** For the astronaut to experience an apparent weight equal to her Earth weight, the centripetal acceleration must be equal to the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. The centripetal acceleration is speed^2 / radius = 9.8 m/s^2. Solving for speed, we get speed = (9.8 m/s^2 * 50 m)^1/2 = 22.1 m/s. The time to complete one rotation is the circumference of the space station divided by the speed: 2ùúã * 50 m / 22.1 m/s = **14.2 seconds**.
- **Question 6:** A rubber band has an unstretched length of 0.1 m. When you hang a 0.5-kg weight on it, its length increases to 0.2 m. What is the spring constant of the rubber band?
    
    - **Answer:** The weight applies a force of 0.5 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 4.9 N to the rubber band. The rubber band stretches by 0.1 m. Using Hooke's law, the spring constant is 4.9 N / 0.1 m = **49 N/m**.
