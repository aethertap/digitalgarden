# Kinematics Problem Solving

1. Draw a [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/motion-diagram\|motion-diagram]]
2. Draw a [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/pictorial-representation\|pictorial-representation]]
3. Make a table of all symbol values that are known from the problem or can be easily figured out from the geometry. Check that signs are consistent with the motion diagram. List **known relationships** as well, such as $v_{1} = v_{2}$. Do **unit conversions** at this point to get everything into a consistent set of units.
5. Use the ideas from the [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/kinematic-overview\|kinematic-overview]] to create a mathematical representation of the problem
6. Use [[projects/school-fall-2024/physics/lessons/kinematic-overview\|kinematic-overview]] equations to solve a mathematical representation
