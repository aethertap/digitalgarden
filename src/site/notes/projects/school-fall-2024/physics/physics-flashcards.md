What is Newton's first law of motion? #flashcard 
(Law of Inertia) An object that is not subject to any outside forces moves at a constant velocity, covering equal distances in equal times along a straight-line path.

What is Newton's second law of motion? #flashcard 
The net force exerted on an object is equal to that objectâ€™s mass times its acceleration. The acceleration is in the same direction as the net force. $F = m a$

What is an *Inertial frame of reference*? #flashcard 
It is the viewpoint of an *inertial object* (one that is not subject to any outside forces, and so is not accelerating). The laws of physics work perfectly from *any* inertial frame of reference!

What is the SI unit for force? #flashcard 
A *newton*, which is one ${{kg\cdot m}\over{s^2}}$ (i.e. *mass (kg)* times *acceleration ($m\over s^2$)*

What is the acceleration due to gravity at Earth's surface? #flashcard 
9.8 $m\over s^2$ or 32 $ft \over s^2$

What is *weight*? #flashcard 
The *force* exerted by mass in a gravitational field.  $w = mg$ where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and the unit is the newton (same as other forces).

What is the equation for the velocity of a falling object? #flashcard 
$v_t = v_i +a t$  where $v_i$ is the initial velocity before we starting the time (0 if we start from rest), $t$ is the time, and $a$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

What is the *position* of a falling ball? #flashcard 
$x_t = x_i + v_i\cdot t + {1\over 2}\cdot a \cdot t^2$ , where $x_i$ is the initial position, $v_i$ is the initial velocity, and $a$ is the acceleration. 

What is a "ballistic trajectory," and what shape does it make? #flashcard 
The path an object follows when the only force acting on it is gravity. The path will trace out a parabola.

What is Newton's third law of motion? #flashcard 
For every force that one object exerts on a second object, there is an equal but oppositely directed force that the second object exerts on the first object.

What are *support forces*? #flashcard 
When two objects are in contact, each pushes the other directly away from its surface wherever they are in contact. These forces are perpendicular to the surface, and are called support forces.

What is the connection between *energy* and *work*? #flashcard 
Energy is the capacity to do work, and work transfers energy (in any form). They have the same unit, the *joule* (${kg\cdot m^2}\over {s^2}$)

What are the three *conserved quantities* of motion? #flashcard 
Momentum, angular momentum, and energy. *Kinetic* energy is *not* conserved, only *total energy* (which includes heat, potential energy, and anything else)!

What is the formula for *work*? #flashcard 
Work is the product of a force and the distance moved *in the direction of the force*: $W = f\cdot d$ 

What is the formula for *kinetic energy*? #flashcard 
Kinetic energy is half of mass times velocity squared: $K = {1 \over 2} m\cdot v^2$ 

What is the formula for *rotational kinetic energy*? #flashcard 
Energy is half the product of rotational mass ($I$) and angular velocity ($\omega$) squared: $K = {1\over 2}\cdot I \cdot \omega
{ #2}
$ 

What is the formula for *momentum*? #flashcard 
Momentum is the project of mass and velocity: $p = m\cdot v$ 

What is the formula for *angular momentum*? #flashcard 
Angular momentum is the product of *rotational mass* and *angular velocity*: $L = I \cdot \omega$ 

What is the formula for *gravitational potential energy*? #flashcard 
Multiply mass by the acceleration due to gravity and height: $P = mgh$ 

What is the *potential gradient*? #flashcard 
The potential gradient is the direction that increases potential energy most quickly. The force on an object always points opposite to the potential gradient direction (an object always accelerates in the direction that reduces its total potential energy as quickly as possible).

What is an *impulse*? #flashcard
An impulse is a change in momentum created by a force acting over time. Its unit is ${kg\cdot m}\over s$, just like momentum.

What is the formula to compute *impulse*? #flashcard 
Impulse is the product of a force and the duration of the force's action: $impulse = f \cdot t$
