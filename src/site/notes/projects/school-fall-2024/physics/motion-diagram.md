# Motion Diagrams

A motion diagram is like a series of freeze-frames from a movie of what's happening. 

1. Draw the representation of the object at several times during the interval you're analyzing. Usually, you just need to draw a dot to represent it.
2. Draw position-change vectors; arrows that go from a dot to the next dot in the sequence. These represent the **change in position** of the object from one frame to the next.
3. Draw the velocity-change vectors; put a position-change vector ($v_{1}$) tail-to-tail with the next position-change vector ($v_{2}$), then draw another vector that connects the **point** of $v_{1}$ to the **point** of $v_{2}$. 

- Position-change vectors are **velocity vectors**
- Velocity-change vectors are **acceleration vectors**
