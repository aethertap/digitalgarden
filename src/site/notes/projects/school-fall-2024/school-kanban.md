## Planned

- [ ] Physics - make an experiment for springs, show Hooke's law and talk about periodic oscillation.
- [ ] Robotics - Build a line maze big enough for the gigantic robots we have. Probably needs to be a line of papers taped together with a fat black stripe running down them, laid out all around the workshop.
- [ ] Robotics - Have a time-trial race to see whose bot can navigate the track fastest and with the least errors.
- [ ] Coding - Outline and schedule stuff from Think Like a programmer
- [ ] Physics - Have kids measure spring constant for different springs.


## Ready to start

- [ ] Physics - Find questions from Thinking Physics that correspond with chapter sections from textbook and note them in the outline
- [ ] Work the AI at [ck12.org](https://www.ck12.org/flexi/) into my set of resources


## In progress

- [ ] #teacher Decide on what content I want to use from [commonlit.org](https://www.commonlit.org) for literature for both kids [[2025-02-14\|2025-02-14]]


## Assigned



## Complete

**Complete**
- [x] [[projects/school-fall-2024/prealgebra/lessons/equations-and-inequalities\|equations-and-inequalities]] - gr7 needs to practice order of operations with variable expressions. Do problems from section 5.3.
- [x] Physics - outline remainder of textbook with detailed headings and a list of terminology for flashcards
- [x] Physics - introduce motion diagrams (Five easy lessons p. 77
- [x] Math - catch up on grading
    [[projects/school-fall-2024/geometry/geometry-gr10\|geometry-gr10]]
- [x] Robotics - assign task to write most basic sensor and servo loop for bots, where they just implement the "drive toward the sensor that sees the line" algorithm.
- [x] #teacher Language: Schedule the [How to write an essay](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY2iGpRrMhnGuZTxNoWT7o-YAlv4hFYsQ) playlist into our curriculum. [[2025-01-30\|2025-01-30]]
- [x] #teacher  [[projects/school-fall-2024/prealgebra/prealgebra-mixed-numbers\|prealgebra-mixed-numbers]] Make a lesson for helping gr7 do better at mixed number order of operations.  [[2025-01-06\|2025-01-06]]
- [x] Outline the computer science fat notebook and get it scheduled into a class
- [x] Teach gr7 Interval notation for section 5.5.
- [x] Create a lesson plan template, folder, and modal form for history
- [x] Science - Find a crash course or other similar source for the General Science background. Maybe IXL has some useful stuff to sprinkle in.
- [x] Design and build a photogate for physics. Dual gate for velocity measure, bonus for speed readout display.
- [x] Make a weekly math quiz using odd-number problems from review sections for each chapter.
- [x] Make a weekly quiz for physics that draws from problems in past assignments.
- [x] Get the kids started on AoPS Alcumus practice
- [x] Create a lesson plan template, folder, and modal form for  geometry
- [x] Make a tool to scan my vault for assignment files and project stuff so that it can be bundled up and sent to the kids automatically. Either that, or set up a way to publish it on our school site.
- [x] Look at what desmos has to offer for the kids
- [x] #hw (robotics) (gr7) Design the IR sensor mounts for your chassis [[2024-12-11\|2024-12-11]]
- [x] #hw (robotics) Hook up the IR sensor to the arduino and use your IRSensor class to detect whether you're on a line and output the answer twice per second to the serial port. [[2024-12-11\|2024-12-11]]
- [x] Literature - Assign outline and rough draft for Extreme Ownership. Report needs to be an executive summary style of paper explaining the method clearly and concisely.
- [x] Physics - make a [[physics-motion-map.canvas|physics-motion-map]] mind map for understanding the properties of motion.
- [x] Assign the IRSensor test project
- [x] Robotics - Review and print gr7's IR sensor mounts
- [x] Create a lesson plan template, folder, and modal form for computer science
- [x] Create a lesson plan template, folder, and modal form for  language
- [x] Create a lesson plan template, folder, and modal form for engineering
- [x] Create a lesson plan template, folder, and modal form for  prealgebra
- [x] Combine CAD, Robotics and electronics into a single project-based Engineering course
- [x] Get the [Physics online classroom](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/Concept-Checkers/Interactives) integrated into the physics schedule
- [x] Physics - Identify which exercises and problems go with which chapter sections and note them in the outline.
- [x] Create a lesson plan template, folder, and modal form for computer physics
- [x] Make a "make me a quiz" prompt for notebook-lm that I can use to test chapters and also build a cumulative review program
- [x] Outline the English language arts notebook and schedule it into a class.
- [x] Come up with some effective prompts for notebook-lm to help with history study. I want it to simlate AP MCQs, and ideally it would also give some short-answer open-ended questions. The kids should use it to study, questioning its results and finding any mistakes or elaborations.
- [x] Make a weekly grammar quiz to refresh them on parts of speech, comma usage, quotation usage, and other common mistakes. (the fat notebook does this)
- [x] General - update [[projects/school-fall-2024/school-dashboard\|school-dashboard]] and [[projects/school-fall-2024/school-day-fall-2024\|school-day-fall-2024]] for spring semester. Give larger blocks of time for engineering, and less for math (it's mostly homework these days). History discussion needs to be increased, and we need some in-class grammar review.
- [x] Robotics - help gr10 do final assembly of her bot. Need to drill out the screw holes a bit and get replacement screws in
