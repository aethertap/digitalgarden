## Concept summary and connections


- apothem 
    - Apothem is distance from center of *regular* polygon to any edge
    - Area of *regular* polygon is $\frac{1}{2}p\cdot a$, where p is perimeter and a is apothem
- area of regular polygon 
- area of irregular polygon 
- tesselation 
- decomposing a polygon 
- apothem from side length of polygon 

## Worked examples

- Find the apothem of a regular hexagon with edge length 5
- Find the area of the hexagon
- Find the area of an irregular hexagon
- Find the area of a rectilinear polygon
