## Concept summary and connections


- A pyramid has a polygon base with each vertex connected to the same point outside of the plane of the base. 
- The apex of the pyramid is the point 
- The base of a pyramid is the polygon, containing all vertices other than the apex. 
- The **slant height** is the distance from the apex to a side of the base. 
- The volume of a pyramid is $\frac{1}{3}h \times a_{base}$

## Guided practice


- [ ] Find a formula for the surface area of a right pyramid whose base is a regular n-gon with side length s, and whose slant height is h.  
- [ ] A triangular pyramid is more commonly called a tetrahedron. A regular tetrahedron is a tetrahedron whose edges all have the same length. Find the volume of a regular tetrahedron that has sides of length 6.
