## Concept summary and connections


- Triangle Inequality 
- The sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the longer side.

## Guided practice


- [ ] If we have two segments with lengths 3 and 7, what possible side lengths could we use for a third segment to make a triangle with them?  
- [ ] Is it possible to have a triangle with side lengths in the ratio 2:4:7?
