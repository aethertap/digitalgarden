## Concept summary and connections


- The distance from a point to a line is the *shortest* possible distance, which means that it's the length of the segment between the point and line that's perpendicular to the line. 
- Perpendicular things have *negative, inverse slopes*... 
- And we know how to find the equation of a line from a point and slope. 
- Given two line equations, the point where they cross is just the point where *both* are true, so solve them as a system of equations to get the end point
- Finally, find the distance between the point and the intersection.

## Guided practice


- [ ] Find the distance between the point $(2,7)$ and the graph of the line $x- 3y = 1$.

- [ ] How many ordered pairs $(x,y)$ satisfy both $14x - 48y + 49 = 0$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 1$?
