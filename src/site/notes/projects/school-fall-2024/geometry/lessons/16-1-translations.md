## Concept summary and connections


- Terminology: Translation of $A$ is $A'$ 
- Translation: Moving something. Specify a direction and a distance (remind you of anything that starts with a 'v' and sounds like Hector?) 
- Mapping: an operation that turns one thing into another one. Example: You could map point (2,2) into (3,4) by adding (1,2) to it.  

## Lesson and worked examples

- Anything can be translated (points, figures, etc.)
- A translated figure is congruent to the original
- With vectors, a translation is done by adding the same vector to all points of the figure.

Anything you can prove about the internal properties of a diagram (i.e. only relating the diagram parts to its own other parts) remains true about all of its translations and rotations. Sometimes it's useful to apply some transformations before you start a proof, mostly just to make things easier for you to see as a human.

> Understanding transformations is often more about learning what stays the same rather than what changes. In the three basic transformations we’ll study in this chapter, everything will stay the same for each transformed figure except its location and orientation.

## Guided practice

1. A **fixed point** of a transformation is a point that is its own image. The **identity** transformation is the transformation that maps every point to itself. In other words, the identity is the ‘do nothing’ transformation. Can a translation that is not the identity have a fixed point?
