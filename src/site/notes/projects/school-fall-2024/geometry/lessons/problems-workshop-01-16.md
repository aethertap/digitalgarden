## Concept summary and connections


- Median triangles are not congruent 
- putting all computation work into the table 
- Labeling all referenced variables in the diagram 

## Worked examples

- [ ] Prove that the triangles formed by drawing median lines in an arbitrary triangle are not necessarily congruent
- [ ] Finding formulas: If it asks for a formula in terms of something, then *that's the only thing your formula can reference*. "Find the area of a hexagon with side length $s$" means that the only variable your formula can use is $s$, so anything else you need **must be converted into an expression of s**.
    - [ ] Find a formula for the area of an octagon with side length $x$.

## Guided practice


- [ ] Prove that medial triangles are not necessarily congruent  
- [ ] Habit: Stop and look before you compute. What is formula for area of equilateral triangle?
