## Guided practice


- [ ] A sphere of radius 12 cm is cut by a plane that passes within 6 cm of the center of the sphere. What is the perimeter of the shape of the intersection?  
- [ ] The density of aluminum is 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. If you made a solid cylinder of aluminum so that it was as small as possible while still having a spherical hole in the center with radius 10 cm, how much would it weigh?
