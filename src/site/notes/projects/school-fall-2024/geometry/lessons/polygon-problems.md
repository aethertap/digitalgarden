## Concept summary and connections

- area and perimeter of polygons 
- interior angles in polygons 
- exterior angles of polygons 
- convex and concave polygons 
- regular and irregular polygons 

## Worked examples

- 9.10: Diagonals BD and CE of regular pentagon ABCDE meet at Q. Find angle BQE. (A is vertex on top in the diagram)
- 9.11: Find the number of diagonals in a polygon with n sides. Start with a few examples, build a table, look for a pattern, then prove the pattern.
- All interior angles of hexagon ABCDEF have measure 120. ABCDEF has sides AB=BC=DE=EF=2 and CD=AF=4. What is the area of the hexagon?


Things to look for that frequently help:
- Parallel lines
- Congruent or similar triangles
- Equal angles
- Complementary or supplementary angles
- Places where an additional line could give you one of those things
- Angles on the extensions of lines
- ***BEWARE*** of assuming a polygon is regular - if it doesn't say so, it isn't so!
