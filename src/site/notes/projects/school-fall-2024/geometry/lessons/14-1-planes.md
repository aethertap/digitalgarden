## Lesson and worked examples

What is a plane? A plane is a flat two-dimensional entity that continues forever. Note: that's not a definition, it's just intuition! We'll get to an actual definition later...

This lesson is basically just going to exercise your intuition about planes, so here are some things to think about:

- If you have a plane, and a point "floating" above it so that it never touches the plane, how would you measure the distance between them?
- If you have a plane, and a line "floating" above it so that it never touches the plane, how would you measure the distance between them? It needs to be a unique number or it has no meaning...
- Is it possible to have two planes that have a "distance" between them? If so, how would you measure *that*?
- What happens when two planes intersect each other? What kind of a geometric thing does the intersection make?

### Definitions of a plane

Remember the equation of a line: $Ax+By=C$. We have order-one variables, which are summed and add up to a constant. In 2d, this is a sort of definition of "flatness." The plane in 3d is similar:

$$
Ax + By + Cz = D
$$
Now we have three linear terms adding to a constant. In 3d, the plane is what we think of as "flat." There are a lot of ways to define a plane, which are useful in different contexts:

- The plane is then the set of all $(x,y,z)$ points that satisfy the plane equation for a particular assignment of $\{A,B,C,D\}$ coefficients.
- If you have three points that aren't collinear, they always form a triangle. That triangle is part of a plane. The plane can be defined to be the set of all points that make the *same* plane when you replace any of the first three with the new one.
- A plane is the set of all points that you can get by adding linear combinations of two independent vectors to a starting point.
- Given a point and a line through the point, a plane is the set of all points that, when used to make another line through the point, make a line that is perpendicular to the starting line.

## Guided practice


- [ ] Given two points, how many different planes pass through the two points?   
- [ ] Given three points, is it always possible to find a plane that passes through all three points?   
- [ ] Given any four points, is it always possible to find a plane that passes through all four points?   
- [ ] Given any two intersecting lines, is there always a plane that contains both lines?
