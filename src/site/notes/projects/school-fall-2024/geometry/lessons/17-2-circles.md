## Concept summary and connections


- Equation of a circle: $(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 = r^2$ 
- In any graph, why is it that subtracting something from the coordinate variable ($x$ or $y$), shifts the graph in the *positive direction* for that coordinate? 
    - The adjusted term is like an infiltrator, sitting in *exactly* the same place as the original variable would have been, *but*...
    - It alters the value just before the rest of the expression gets a chance to work with it. The expression ends up computing all of its values *as if the axis was shifted by that amount*, so the resulting graph is shifted.
    - A similar thing happens when you multiply a coordinate variable - If for example you double the $x$ coordinate, the effect is as if the x-axis is stretched by a factor of 2, and so the graph itself is *squished to half the size* in the x dimension.
    - This is *always true for any graph of any equation*, as long as every instance of the variable is modified in the same way.

## Guided practice


- [ ] (a) Find an equation whose graph is a circle with center $(4,-5)$ and radius $3\sqrt{2}$.   
- [ ] Explain why the graph of the equation $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ where $h$, $k$, and $r$ are constants with $r>0$, is a circle with center $(h,k)$ and radius $\color[rgb]{0.11,0.21,0.37}r$.  
- [ ] What is the center and radius of the graph of $x^2 +2x +y^2 -6y = 6$
