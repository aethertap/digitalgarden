#  16.4 - Dilation

## Concept summary and connections


- Dilation is scaling - you change the size of a diagram, but keep all of the angles and length ratios constant. 
- Dilation has a center and a scale factor. Every part of the diagram is changed: 
    - A vector connecting the center to any part of the diagram will be parallel to the vector from the center to the corresponding part of the image
    - The vector connecting the center to the image will be scaled in length according to the scale factor (scale factor 2 means twice as long as the original, for example)
    - A negative scale factor means that the vector is pointing antiparallel to the original (opposite direction along the same line).

## Guided practice


- [ ] How does the area of a square change if it is dilated by a factor of 2? How about by 1/2?  
- [ ] What happens when you perform a dilation with a scale factor of -1?  
- [ ] Triangle $A'B'C'$ is the image of a dilation of triangle $ABC$ about the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The dilation has a positive scale factor.  
    - [ ] (a) Suppose $\triangle A'B'C'$ is entirely outside $\triangle ABC$. Is the scale factor greater than 1 or less than 1?  
    - [ ] (b) Suppose $\triangle A'B'C'$ is entirely inside $\triangle ABC$. Is the scale factor greater than 1 or less than 1?  
    - [ ] (c) What happens if the scale factor equals 1?   
- [ ] Square $A'B'C'D'$ is the image of a dilation of square $ABCD$ about $A$ with scale factor 3. Suppose $AB = 2$.  
    - [ ] (a) Find $AA'$, $AB'$, and $BB'$.  
    - [ ] (b) Find $BC'$ and $CD'$.   
- [ ] Let $A'$ and $B'$ be the images of points $A$ and $B$, respectively, under a dilation with center $O$ and positive scale factor $k$.  
    - [ ] (a) Show that $\triangle AOB \sim\triangle A'OB'$.  
    - [ ] (b) Show that $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{A'B'}$ and $A'B'/AB=k$.
