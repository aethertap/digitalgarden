## Concept summary and connections


- A rotation of $\theta$ about a point $O$ makes a **congruent** image of the original subject, such that any segment drawn from $O$ to a point on the original will be at angle $\theta$ to a segment from $O$ to the corresponding point on the image. 
- A rotation of $360\degree$ always makes an image that coincides with the original. 
- Rotations can be more than $360\degree$! Don't forget that when you do your problems! 

## Lesson and worked examples

 A rotation is a transformation that:
 - produces an image that is congruent to the original thing being rotated
 - can change both the orientation and position of the diagram (you can rotate about a point outside of the diagram, and that will make it move)
 - "spins" the diagram by a specific angle.

Rotations always have a center point and an angle, and in 2D can be either clockwise or counterclockwise. By convention, ***a positive angle rotation is counterclockwise***. This is just an arbitrary choice, but it was made long ago and people stick with it to make it easier to communicate.

## Guided practice


- [ ] After I draw a figure, I rotate it $\color[rgb]{1,1,1}48^\circ$ about some point $\color[rgb]{1,1,1}P$. If the image of this rotation coincides exactly with the original figure, is it true that the image of a rotation of the figure $\color[rgb]{1,1,1}72^\circ$ about $\color[rgb]{1,1,1}P$ must also coincide with the figure?   
- [ ] Through how many different positive angles $\color[rgb]{1,1,1}\theta$ less than $\color[rgb]{1,1,1}360^\circ$ is it possible to rotate a regular dodecagon clockwise about its center such that its image coincides with the original dodecagon?
