## Concept summary and connections


- Inscribed angle in circle 
- Inscribed angle in semicircle is right 

- The measure of any angle inscribed in a circle (meaning that the angle's vertex and both rays intersect the circle) is always equal to half of the intersected arc.
- The measure of any angle inscribed in a semicircle so that the rays connect to the end points of the arc is always 90$\degree$ 

## Lesson and worked examples

- Useful tools for solving inscribed angle problems:
    - Any triangle you make inside a circle where the center of the circle is a vertex will be isosceles (because two sides are equal to the radius)
    - Any angle inscribed in a circle will have a measure equal to half the measure of the arc it intercepts
    - All inscribed angles that intersect a semicirclular arc are right angles
