## Cylinders

- A cylinder is a circular prism. 
- The **axis** of a cylinder is the line that connects the center points of the circular ends. 
- Other curved shapes can be the ends of general cylinders, but they will be named specially. A "cylinder" almost always means a **right, circular cylinder**. 
- The surface area of a cylinder is equal to the area of the **bases** plus the **lateral surface area**
- The **lateral surface area** is the area of the portion of the cylinder that "wraps around it". You can find this area by multiplying the **circumference of the bases** by the height of the cylinder.
- The volume of a cylinder is the area of the base times the height of the cylinder.

## Guided practice


- [ ] Suppose we take a cross-section of a cylinder that is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. What shape is this cross-section?   
- [ ] What is the shape of a cross-section of a cylinder that contains the axis of the cylinder?   
- [ ] 1What is the shape of a cross-section of a cylinder that is parallel to the axis of the cylinder?   
- [ ] The figure at right shows a right circular cylinder (a.k.a. a cylinder) with radius 3 and height 5.   
- [ ] Find the volume of the cylinder.   
- [ ] Suppose we cut the curved surface of the cylinder along the dotted line shown (assume the dotted line is perpendicular to the bases) and ‘unroll’ the surface into a plane. What type of figure results?   
- [ ] What is the lateral surface area of the cylinder?  
- [ ] What is the total surface area of the cylinder?   
- [ ] Find formulas for the volume, lateral surface area, and total surface area of a cylinder with radius r and height h.
