## Concept summary and connections


- constructing regular polygons 
- construct regular pentagon 
- construct regular heptagon 

Constructing these shapes is cool, but it gives you more than just the ability to make the shape. Remember that regular polygons have internal and external angles with known measures; that means that you can now construct angles with any of those measures! So, if you ever need a 108$\degree$ angle, you just need to construct enough of a pentagon to get the first corner and edges defined, and you have exactly what you need.

You can also take half- and quarter- angles of all of these, which gives you even more options.
