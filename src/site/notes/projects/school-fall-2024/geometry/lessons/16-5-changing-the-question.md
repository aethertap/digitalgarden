## Concept summary and connections


- Look at extreme values 
- Cut up and rearrange the diagram into easier pieces 

When you're solving problems that have been posed to you, you can generally assume that there is a solution. That means that anything in the problem that isn't specified is free to be adjusted, as long as you respect the constraints of what was asked. It really pays off to look at the extremes in a case like that - check for things like, "What if it's zero?" or "What if they're equal?" If those things are allowed in the way the problem is set up, you can usually get some powerful clues about what to do, or even outright solve the problem, without much work at all. Consider the extremes that make things symmetrical, remove parts of the problem entirely, or simplify it in some other way.

In geometry in particular, we work with diagrams that can be very complex. Another powerful strategy is to rearrange parts of the diagram into shapes that are easier to work with. Think of an area that's broken into a bunch of pieces, but can be assembled into a square - it's much easier to compute the area of a square than to compute the areas of half a dozen odd-shaped things. If you can rearrange things without changing their sizes and shapes, *and you are **certain** that it doesn't change the answer*, then this can really help.

## Guided practice


- [ ] The side length of the largest square is 10 inches. The midpoints of the sides of the largest square are connected to form a smaller square. Opposite vertices and the midpoints of opposite sides of the smaller square are then connected as shown. What is the number of square inches in the area of the shaded region?

- [ ] A circle is inscribed in a large square and circumscribed about a smaller square. The area of the larger square is 8 square meters. What is the number of square meters in the area of the smaller square?

- [ ] In the figure, $ABCD$ is a square with side length 1, and $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$, respectively. Find the area of the shaded region.

- [ ] In the diagram we have two concentric circles, and chord $\overline{AB}$ of the large circle is tangent to the smaller circle. Given that $AB = 8$, find the area of the region between the two circles.
