## Concept summary and connections


- Refresher: Completing the Square 
- Refresher: Graphing functions 
- The graph of an equation is the shape made by drawing in all points that *satisfy* the equations - mark all places where the coordinates result in a true equation. 

## Lesson and worked examples

A line equation always:
- Has powers of 1 for all variables
- Can be written in the form (except for the vertical line $x=c$, which is not a function)
    - $(y - a) = m(x - b)$ (point slope, where the point $(a,b)$ is on the line and the slope is $m$
    - $y=mx+b$ (slope-intercept, the slope is $m$, and the line crosses the $y$-axis at $b$)


### Finding the equation of a line

Starting with two points $a = (x_{a},y_{a})$ and $b=(x_{b},y_{b})$ on the line, you can find the equation of the line with these steps: 
1. Find the slope: remember, $\text{slope} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}$:
    1. $m = \frac{y_{b}-y_{a}}{x_{b}-x_{a}}$ 
2. Write the point-slope equation: $(y-y_{b}) = m(x-x_{b})$

## Guided practice

- [ ] Find an equation whose graph is the line passing through the points $(-1,7)$ and $(-5,-3)$  
- [ ] Find an equation whose graph is the line with slope 4 and $y$-intercept $(0,-3)$.  
    - [ ] (a) Find the length of the segment with endpoints $(-4,-3)$ and $(6,1)$.  
    - [ ] (b) Find a formula for the distance between the points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$.   
- [ ] Let point $A$ be $(x_1,y_1)$ and point $B$ be $(x_2,y_2)$. Let $M$ be the point with coordinates $\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2},\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\right).$. In this problem we show that $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$.  
    - [ ] (a) Show that $AM = MB$.  
    - [ ] (b) Show that $M$ is on $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.   
- [ ] Explain why two different lines that have the same slope are parallel.
