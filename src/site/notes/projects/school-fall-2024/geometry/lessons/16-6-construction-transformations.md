#  16.6 Construction: Transformations


- Spin, flip, and scale using just a ruler and compass 

This is just a puzzle-solving game, where you have to use the facts you know about angles, lengths, similarity, and all that jazz in order to create a drawing. Make sure you justify your steps!

As you draw the construction, number the construction marks and write the reasoning for them to the side (use the numbers to keep them organized).


## Guided practice


Given are points $C$ and $T$. Construct point $U$ such that $U$ is the image of point $T$ under a $30^\circ$ rotation about $C$.

Given is point $A$ and line $m$. Construct point $B$ such that $B$ is the image of point $A$ upon reflection over $m$.

Given are parallel lines $m$ and $n$ and point $P$ between the lines. Construct an equilateral triangle such that one vertex is $P$, one vertex is on $m$, and one vertex is on $n$.
