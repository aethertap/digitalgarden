- Write a function to count the words in a string
- Write a function to count the *unique* words in a string
- Write a function to find the longest word in a string
- Write a function to create a concordance of the words in a string
    - Split text by non-alphabetic
    - Use a map to keep track of words you've seen
- Use your functions to
