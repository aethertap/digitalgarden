## Concept summary and connections

Designing a program, start with what you want to end up with. Repeatedly ask what you need in order to get that, until you have figured out a basic overview of your system's big parts.

- block diagrams 
- modular programming 
- top-down program design 
- program high-level design 

## Examples

- Design a tool to count lines of text in a file
    - What do you have to work with (input)?
    - What do you want to end up with (output)?
    - What things need to happen in order to get from one to the other (functional blocks)?

## Homework

- [x] #hw (programming) Finish designing your line counting app with the functions you'll need and the way that they feed data into each other (don't write actual code unless you want to) [[2025-01-08\|2025-01-08]]
