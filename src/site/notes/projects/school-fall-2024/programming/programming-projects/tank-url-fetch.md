# Fetching code from a URL for the tank brain

Goal: 
1. Let the users put their code in a github repo and fetch fresh versions whenever it changes.
2. Commit changes made in the online editor to the repo directly. Possibly: Let the user use the github builtin editor instead of using our own.
[Github Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps) might let me interact directly with the repository
