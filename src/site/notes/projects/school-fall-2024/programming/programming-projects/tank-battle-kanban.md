## Backlog

- [ ] make the appearance more attractive


## ready to start

- [ ] Put error messages into the game's output area so they are visible.
- [ ] Add multiple tanks and check that the radar and collisions work properly


## in progress

- [ ] Shooting - make the bullets cause damage and disappear when they collide with something.


## complete

**Complete**
- [x] Make the gun track its shot energy, and make the bullet's damage depend on the shot energy.
- [x] Add radar scanning results to the sensor data.
- [x] Limit the turning speed, with the full track speed available, the turn is too fast.
- [x] Bullets should have the tank's velocity added to their initial velocity.
- [x] Set up localstorage to keep the entered code across page refreshes
- [x] Make a better tank graphic model
- [x] Add radar controls
- [x] Add gun controls
- [x] Add a button to reset the tank to its initial position and orientation.
- [x] Connect the debug output to the html block meant to hold it. I need a toggle there also that keeps only the current iteration's output in view in order to make it easier to see what's happening.
- [x] Figure out the directions and angle-handedness in matter-js and fix my steering code to match it.
- [x] Make shipIt reset the tank
