# Making planning tools with obsidian

Running school is extremely complex, and I was not able to keep up with the cognitive load for long. The startup friction of class planning overwhelmed me because I am currently teaching an entire highschool and an entire middle school curriculum. This is how I am using obsidian to make it possible (hopefully).

## Plugins you need

- Templater
- Dataview
- Modal forms
- Obsidian Kanban
- Natural Language Dates

The basic idea is this: I need to have a way to be prompted for everything that goes into a lesson plan, automatically. It needs to give me links to all of the resources I'm working with, and pointers to where and how to search for specific things to add in. I need to link this with an outline of the course that is easy to track and manage, so that each topic I'm covering tells me what books and other stuff I need to have ready and what topics I need to brush up on. All of the stuff should be right in front of me when I sit down to plan.

First, outline the main sequence your course is going to follow. I like to have a textbook for this because someone else did the hard work of organizing and selecting the material that needs to be covered. If there isn't a book, I look for some other resource for sequencing. Otherwise, it's a *lot* more work.

Once you have the basic outline, you need to design the lessons. I don't find much value in outlining a lesson in terms of *what I cover*, as much as outlining it in terms of *what I'm going to use* while I teach it. Generally I don't need to be reminded about formulas and other details once I've seen them at least recently, but if there's something I want to be sure to get right I'll put a note there.

Far more important is to find additional resources like videos and structured lab activities, and to make myself checklists for getting all of that crap together.

So, after I have a basic idea of what the lessons need to have, I make a template. The template is specific to the class and it has all of the links to all of the things I use while planning lessons.

Next make a modal form that has answers for things that you need to fill in for the lesson. The things I've been using are:

- Topics that I'm going to cover
- Web resources like videos and simuators
- Page numbers in the textbooks
- The scheduled date for the lesson
- List of guided practice problems
- Link to any active project for the class

The template takes that data and makes a note out of it. It generates a few extra things to help as well:
- Search links for youtube and google for every topic being covered
- Link back to the class index page

## Index page

I'm trying out a kanban for the class index page, treating it like a project with tasks and an overall goal. We'll see how it goes, but initially I like having the long list of checkboxes presented in a more screen-efficient way. The downside of the kanban is that I can't put anything *other* than the plan into it, so all of my resource links and planning notes have to be in another file. There might be some use in making a special task list for just resources and notes that isn't meant to be "completed". I'll try that to see how it works.

## The important part

All of this is basically just here to force me to remember all of the little parts that have to come together every time to make a working lesson. It's too easy to fall into the trap of just winging it, especially for topics that I already know really well. That's not good enough though. I'm hoping that having this planning tool will make the friction of actually making a real plan low enough for me to do it consistently every day.

One feature of the forms is that they can have required fields. I'm using those as a prod for my future self in cases like the guided practice questions - the lesson isn't complete unless I have some guided practice questions planned. That forces me to look through the problems and subject material and actually pick out some things to do interactively in class.
