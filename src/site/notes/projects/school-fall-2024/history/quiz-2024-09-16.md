# History Quiz Section 1.1

## What is the name of the philosophy that grew out of the mixing of Confucianism with Buddhism?

Neo-confucianism

## How did it differ from those philosophies?

Neo-Confucianism was focused on internal self-development, but still made filial piety and hierarchy an important part of the society's structure.

## How did the Vietnamese change the stricter parts of Confucianism?

The Vietnamese refused to bind the feet of women, and gave women greater rights within property and marriage law, allowing them to remarry for example.

## What was a key change in the way that bureaucrats were hired in the Song Dynasty? How did that effect the Chinese economy?

The Song dynasty introduced a civil service exam, which anyone who wanted to work as a civil servant could take (including peasants). Passing the exam meant you could work as a civil servant, which gave the lowest tiers of Chinese society a new way to rise in status and power. That was a big departure from the previous inheritance-based system, and made it possible for peasants to be a much larger part of the Chinese economy in.
