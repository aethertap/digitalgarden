# AP World History Document-based-question rubric

This is how the AP World Document-Based Questions are graded, and we will be sticking to this format as closely as possible for this class.

## Thesis/Claim (1 pt.)

The essay responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning. 

## Context (1 pt.)

The essay describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. 

## Evidence (0-3 pts.)

1. The essay provides specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt. 
2. The essay supports an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence. 
3. The essay makes use of specific historical evidence to support an argument in response to the prompt. Besides that, the essay uses Evidence beyond the Documents: Uses at least one additional piece of the specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the documents) relevant to an argument about the prompt.

## Analysis and Reasoning (0-2 pts)

1. The essay uses historical reasoning (e.g. comparison, causation, continuity and change) to frame or structure an argument that addresses the prompt. 
2. The essay demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question.
