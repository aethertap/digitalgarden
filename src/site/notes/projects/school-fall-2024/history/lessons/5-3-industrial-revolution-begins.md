## Discussion

The pace is really picking up now, as increased freedom and working capital lets people but some effort into improving their lives. Technology becomes center-stage as people realize that they could do far, far more with much less effort.

### As we watch

- What was *better* about life during this time?
- What was *worse*?
- How people's experiences of the industrial revolution differ? Who benefited? Was anyone *worse* off after? How?
- In today's world, we're currently in the middle of the "AI Revolution." If it works like the Industrial revolution did, who will be making the money from it? Who will be poorer for it, at least in the short term? What do you think is likely to happen as a result, based on this example?
