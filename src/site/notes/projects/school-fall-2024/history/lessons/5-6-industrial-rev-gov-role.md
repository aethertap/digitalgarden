### Meiji restoration

After Britain humiliated China in the opium wars, and Commodore Matthew Perry forced the opening of trade, Japan realized they needed to be proactive with industrialization or die. The Meiji Restoration started with the overthrow of the Shogun, then created major changes to keep Japanese culture from being overrun by Europeans.

- abolish feudalism
- Constitutional monarchy like Prussia (emperor rules through subordinate political leader)
- equality before law, abolish cruel punishments
- reoganized military to be like Prussian
- Created a school system
- built railroads
- subsidized industrialization

All in 50 years.

## Discussion

- This period of history brought enormous change, and it's hard to keep the ideology of different places separate from their ascendant power. Imagine a world in which the Ottoman Empire, or China, had been first to adopt the industrial technologies - how might the rest of history been changed since that time? Consider the differences in culture between those societies and modern western culture. Technology is just a tool, it could have been used to spread any of the world's ideologies.
