## Revolutions

The Enlightenment ideals caused people around the world to believe that there could be a better life with a different social structure. Many of them saw revolution as the only way to achieve it, and there were *many* revolutions during this time. Some succeeded, but many ultimately failed.

The driving ideals were progress, reason, and natural law.

**Natural Law**: (my definition) The minimal law that is required for a large number of humans to coexist and resolve their disputes without violence. It's the only law that can both prevent violence when followed, and requires violence when it is broken (as there is no other way to punish people who violate the social contract other than forcing them against their will).

- American revolution: 7/4/1776 - 1783 (successful)
- New Zealand wars: Maori fighting the British, unsuccessful by 1872
- French Revolution: 
    - Gov spending too much, calls meeting. 
    - Commoners break off into National Assembly because they had no voting power
    - Storming the Bastille, peasant uprising, king forced to cede gov to National Assembly
    - Abolition of feudalism, adoption of Declaration of the Rights of Man
    - **Reign of Terror** - revolutionary gov executes thousands of opponents, including king and queen, many with the guillotine.
- Haitian Revolution
    - Extremely violent
    - Revolution of slaves against masters
    - Only permanently successful slave rebellion
- Napoleon Bonaparte
