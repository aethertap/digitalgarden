## Context (what else is happening around this place/time?)

Italy controls trade with the East, but Europe wants better access. They send explorers.
- Want to claim territory (and its wealth) first
- Want to spread their religions
- Want to gain in power

### People
- **Prince Henry the Navigator** (1394-1460) became the first European monarch to sponsor seafaring expeditions, to search for an all-water route to the east as well as for African gold. Under him, Portugal began importing enslaved Africans by sea, replacing the overland slave trade.
- **Bartholomew Diaz** sailed around the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, in 1488, into waters his crew did not know. Diaz feared a mutiny if he continued pushing eastward, so he returned home.
- **Vasco Da Gama** sailed farther east than Diaz, landing in India in 1498, There he claimed territory as part of Portugal’s empire. The Portuguese ports in India were a key step in expanding Portugal’s trade in the Indian Ocean and with points farther east.
