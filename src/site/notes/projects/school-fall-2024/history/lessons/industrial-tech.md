    - Chemical engineering (dyes, rubber)
    - Electricity (electric street cars, lighting
    - Telegraph (efficient communication)

    - Development of interior regions: The areas of land far from major rivers and seaports could now be reached and developed, opening much more space 
    - Increased trade and migration: Goods could be moved farther, faster, and into new places. People moved to make their lives better (more money, opportunities, etc).
