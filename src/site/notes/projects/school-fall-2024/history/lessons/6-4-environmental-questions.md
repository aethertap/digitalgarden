## Discussion

- We've read about how brutal the conditions were for indigenous people who lived in places that were claimed by the world's empires. Do you think it would be possible to make contact between cultures as different as those without such horrible abuse? How could it have been different? Could the native cultures survive that contact, even if the intentions of the empires were genuinely beneficent?

## Homework

- [ ] #hw (hist) Write a ACE response to the question, "Could the imperialist nations of the 18th-20th centures have avoided destroying the indigenous cultures they found, but still gained access to the natural resources they wanted?"
