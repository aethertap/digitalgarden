## Reading

> “Under the Mughals, Hindus and Muslims interacted in economics, politics, social life, the arts, and culture. Through migration and conversion, the Muslim population of India grew from about 400,000 in 1200, . . . to 12.8 million in 1535, to perhaps 50 million by 1800. Muslim scholars and Sufi religious mystics and saints migrated to India from Iran, Turkey, and Central Asia. Some came in search of government jobs, others for new cultural opportunities, to study, or to spread their own beliefs. Some of the best poets immigrated from Persia.
> 
>Similarly, imperial court painters, who produced masterpieces in the Persian and Mughal miniature styles, interacted with painters of the Rajput schools in local Hindu courts across north India, resulting in artistic innovations in both. On the level of mystical belief and experience, an astonishing syncretism emerged between Hindus and Muslims, especially in the poetry of Kabir [died circa 1520] and of Guru Nanak (1469–1538), the originator of the Sikh religion. Mystics in the two communities, Hindu bhakti (devotional) worshippers and Muslim Sufis, frequently had warm personal relations and often attracted followers from each others’ communities.”
- Howard Spodek and Michele Langford Louro, United States historians, article published in a scholarly journal, 2007

## Context (what else is happening around this place/time?)

Great land-based empires existed before 1450 and after 1750. However, between these years, several of history’s greatest land-based empires reached their peak of wealth and influence. Among these were the Songhai in West Africa the Safavids based in Persia the Mughals in northern India the Ottomans in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Northern Africa and the Manchus in eastern Asia. They were multiethnic states that had direct political control over large regions and overland trade routes.

## Review Questions

Prompt template for notebookLM:

Please create a list of 10 multiple choice questions covering unit 3. Each question should have four possible answers. Two of the answers should be easily recognized as incorrect, one answer should be almost correct but wrong because of the consequences of the events or connections between entities described in the unit, and one answer should be fully correct. Please provide the correct answer along with explanations of why each option was either correct or incorrect.

Here is a list of 10 multiple choice questions covering Unit 3 of the sources:

1. What was one consequence of the introduction of **new crops** from the Americas to Europe?
    
    - a) The population of Europe declined due to diseases spread through the Columbian Exchange.
    - b) Europeans became overly reliant on potatoes, leading to the Irish Potato Famine in the 19th century.
    - c) **New crops led to population growth and new dietary options in Europe.**
    - d) The introduction of American crops created severe environmental degradation in Europe due to overfarming.
    
    **Explanation:** The introduction of new crops like potatoes and maize from the Americas to Europe led to population growth and new dietary options. Option (a) is incorrect because the Columbian Exchange did spread diseases, but it also led to population growth in Europe. (b) is incorrect because the Irish Potato Famine occurred much later. Option (d) is incorrect because overfarming was a larger issue in the Americas than in Europe.
    
2. **Akbar the Great**, the Mughal ruler, is known for his policy of religious tolerance. Which action best exemplifies this policy?
    
    - a) He persecuted members of the Sikh religion.
    - b) He forced Hindus to convert to Islam.
    - c) He promoted the synthesis of Islam with Hinduism, creating a new religion called Din-i Ilahi.
    - d) **He eliminated the jizya tax on non-Muslims, demonstrating acceptance of different faiths.**
    
    **Explanation:** Akbar's elimination of the jizya, a tax on non-Muslims, is a clear example of his policy of religious tolerance. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they contradict his policy. Option (c) is partially correct, as Akbar did attempt to create a syncretic religion, but it was not a primary example of his tolerance towards existing religions.
    
3. The **Ottoman devshirme system** involved:
    
    - a) The enslavement of African people for labor on plantations.
    - b) **The recruitment of Christian boys who were converted to Islam and trained for military or administrative service.**
    - c) The practice of tax farming, where individuals collected taxes for the state in exchange for a share of the revenue.
    - d) The construction of lavish palaces like the Taj Mahal to demonstrate the power and wealth of the empire.
    
    **Explanation:** The devshirme system was a unique practice in the Ottoman Empire where Christian boys were taken, converted to Islam, and trained for elite roles. Option (a) describes a different form of slavery. Options (c) and (d) are related to Ottoman practices but not to the devshirme system.
    
4. Which statement best describes the **economic relationship** between **Spain and its American colonies** during the 16th and 17th centuries?
    
    - a) The colonies traded freely with other European powers, enriching themselves and undermining Spanish control.
    - b) **Spain extracted vast amounts of silver from its colonies, enriching the Spanish crown and stimulating the European economy.**
    - c) The colonies developed strong manufacturing industries, competing with Spain and ultimately declaring independence.
    - d) Spain primarily sought agricultural products from its colonies, neglecting the potential for mineral wealth.
    
    **Explanation:** Spain's colonial economy was heavily reliant on the extraction of silver from its American colonies. This wealth enriched Spain but also had global consequences. Option (a) is incorrect as Spain maintained strict control over colonial trade. Options (c) and (d) are not accurate representations of the economic dynamics of the Spanish Empire.
    
5. The **Atlantic slave trade** had a profound impact on the Americas. Which statement best characterizes its effects?
    
    - a) It led to the widespread adoption of indigenous labor systems like the mit'a.
    - b) It resulted in the equitable distribution of wealth among European colonists.
    - c) It contributed to the rise of industrial capitalism in Europe, but did not significantly impact the Americas.
    - d) **It led to the forced migration of millions of Africans, creating a system of racialized chattel slavery and shaping the social and economic landscape of the Americas.**
    
    **Explanation:** The Atlantic slave trade resulted in the horrific forced migration of millions of Africans, creating lasting racial and social divisions in the Americas. Option (a) is incorrect because the slave trade replaced indigenous labor systems. Option (b) is incorrect because wealth was concentrated among European elites. Option (c) is partially correct, as the slave trade contributed to European wealth, but its impact on the Americas was undeniable.
    
6. Which European monarch broke with the **Catholic Church** and established a **national church** in England during the 16th century?

    - a) It led to rapid population growth due to the introduction of new food crops.
    - b) **It resulted in the deaths of millions of indigenous people due to diseases like smallpox.**
    - c) It had a minimal impact, as indigenous populations were largely isolated from European contact.
    - d) It led to the blending of indigenous and European cultures, creating a harmonious society.
    
    **Explanation:** The Columbian Exchange had a devastating impact on indigenous populations in the Americas, primarily due to the introduction of European diseases like smallpox.
