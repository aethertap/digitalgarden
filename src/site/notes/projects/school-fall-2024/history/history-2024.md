## NotebookLM Prompts


### Interactive quizzing over sections and units

Please interactively quiz my knowledge of the material covering land-based empires from **the unit in question**. Please ask one question, then wait for my response, and finally evaluate my response and provide constructive feedback. Questions should be a mixture of short-answer open-ended questions and multiple choice. Focus on the causes and effects, as well as the connections between events and entities in the unit. After providing feedback, please ask me if I would like to continue answering questions. If I answer yes, generate another question according to this structure.

### MCQ quiz generation along lines of AP exam

Please create a list of 10 multiple choice questions covering **The unit or section in question**. Each question should have four possible answers. Two of the answers should be easily recognized as incorrect, one answer should be almost correct but wrong because of the consequences of the events described in the unit, and one answer should be correct. Please provide the correct answer along with explanations of why each option was either correct or incorrect.

### Generate JSON-formatted flashcards

Please generate a set of flashcards to help me learn the material in **the unit in question**. Each card front should appear only once. If a card has more than one possible answer, include all answers on the same card instead of making multiple cards for the same question. Please focus on the associations between systems and entities in the source material, not just fact recall.  I would like to have 20 cards in JSON syntax, as an array of objects. Each object is one flashcard, and has a "front" and a "back" property whose value is the card's front or back text, respectively.



## Class Structure

1. Kids do the reading and answer MCQ and short answer ahead of class. (due Mondays and Thursdays)
2. Kids make flashcards for the data they gather from the book and videos.
3. We watch the heimler video in class. (Mondays and Thursdays)
4. We answer the questions again, making corrections and updating with more detail.
