# Raising my game

It's clear to me that I need to find a way to be more effective as a teacher. The kids are struggling with some of the material, and it's my responsibility to get them to the point of understanding on the most efficient path.

## On my best days

On the days when I feel like I've really nailed it, there are a few things that are always true:
- I had a clear plan for what to show them and how to do it. There was no scramble to quickly review what they're learning and try to make up examples on the whiteboard.
- I had extra resources ready - videos, experiments, practice problems
- I had energy that I could project into the lesson
- They were awake and alert

## On my worst days

On the other hand, my worst days generally fall into a simple pattern: Failure to plan and exhaustion.


## Planning is the key

I need to make sure I always have a plan for the day. I need to explain, then have them do guided practice with immediate feedback, and finally give them problems to work on independently.

*In class* there should be explanation and guided practice. I should not be having them do their homework as part of the class.

I need to make sure they are taking *useful* notes. Notes are useful when they create connections and support creating practice flashcards, and when they clearly lay-out both *how* and *why* when that applies (like physics or math).

## Routine

In order to consistently have a plan, I'm going to have to establish a routine with as close to zero resistance built-in as possible. 

1. Go to the school room in the morning
2. Use a lesson template with a form to make sure you don't forget to add important pieces.
    1. Each subject needs its own template with specific requirements
    2. I need to have a dashboard page with auto-generated links to create lessons in the right places for the day in question. It should be able to work into the future.
3. *Read the lesson material*
4. If there are exercises, pick three to do in class and *work them out ahead of time with clear, separated steps with explanations*. **Copy and paste existing examples whenever possible!**
    1. I want this to be digital, which means I can't be trying to type it in latex math notation because it's too slow. [Handwriting to latex online processor](https://webdemo.myscript.com/views/math/index.html#)
    2. I installed a Latex snippet tool in obsidian to help
5. Add extra resource links
6. Send lesson notes to kids (rsync, make it part of the syncup script)
7. Assign problems for guided practice to be done *in class while I watch*
    1. Pick one problem from each type that's in the assignment, have them do that while I hover and make corrections
8. Assign problems for homework
9. Add some fun (jokes, videos, whatever I can dig up)
