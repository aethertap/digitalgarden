# ACT Prep Practice Test 1 - warmup

Practice test 1 is on page 43 of the ACT big book. We will take this test to see where you're at and figure out strengths and weaknesses.

This is going to work just like a real ACT:
- You will be able to use a *scientific calculator*, but only on the math test and it must be a plain calculator, not a phone app
- Each test section will be timed according to the alotted time in the book
- Scratch paper for calculations will be provided
- circle answers directly in the book, feel free to underline and otherwise mark up this test.

## The Test Itself

- There are 4 sections: 
    - English
    - math
    - Reading
    - Science
- There is an optional Writing test as well.
