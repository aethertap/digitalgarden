## Concept summary and lesson


- Altitude of a triangle
    - The altitude of a triangle is the distance from one vertex to the opposite side (it's always perpendicular to the side, even if that means it lands **outside** of the triangle!)
- isosceles triangles 
    - Isosceles triangles have two equal sides, which are called the "legs" of the triangle
    - A right triangle can be isosceles, but only if two angles are 45 degrees. The hypotenuse length is then $\sqrt{ 2 }\cdot l$, where $l$ is the length of one of the legs.
- 30-60-90 right triangle 
    - A 30-60-90 right triangle is half of an equilateral triangle
    - Its sides are in the proportion $1:\sqrt{ 3 }:2$

## Guided practice


- [ ] If one leg of an isosceles right triangle has length 5, then what are the lengths of the other leg and the hypotenuse of the triangle?   
- [ ] If one leg of an isosceles right triangle has length 8, then what are the lengths of the other leg and the hypotenuse of the triangle?   
- [ ] If we know the length of one leg of an isosceles right triangle, then whatâ€™s a fast way to find the length of the hypotenuse?   
- [ ] Suppose $\triangle ABC$ is equilateral with side length $6$. Find the length of an altitude of $\triangle ABC$.  
- [ ] Find the area of $\triangle ABC$.
