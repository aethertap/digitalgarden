## Concept summary and connections

### part 1
- word problems 
- identifying important data from word problems 
- identifying relationships from word problems 
- Creating expressions from word problems 

### part 2
- Connecting multiple equations in order to solve for multiple variables
    - need at least one independent equation per variable, or can't solve
    - Each equation is a line if you graph it, and they have to intersect in a point in order to have a unique solution
    - parallel and overlapping lines have zero and infinite solutions respectively


## Worked examples

- You sold 90 donuts altogether
- Jelly donuts are $7, and plain are $4
- If you made $399, how many of each type did you sell?
- What kind of donut brought in more money?

1. let x = the number of jelly donuts sold
2. let y = the number of plain donuts sold

$$
\begin{align} \\

x + y &= 90 &\text{given} \\ 
7x &= \text{money from jelly donuts} & \text{given} \\
4y &= \text{money from plain donuts} & \text{given} \\
7x+4y &= 399 &\text{given, total is sum of parts from each kind} \\
y &= 90 -x & \text{subtraction Property of Equality, from (2)} \\
7x + 4(90-x) &= 399 &\text{substitution property of equality} \\
7x + 360 - 4x &= 399 &\text{distributive property} \\
3x &= 39 & \text{subtraction property of equality} \\
x &= 13 \text{ jelly donuts} & \text{division property of equality} \\
13 + y &= 90 & \text{substitution property of equality} \\
y &= 73 \text{ plain donuts} & \text{subtraction property of equality} \\
\end{align} 

$$

### How to solve problems!

1. Identify what the unknowns are that you're trying to resolve. What do you want to know? What will the answer have?
2. Identify all of the data from the problem and write it down
3. What relationships (equations) can I find that connect parts of the data?
    1. Write down equations that connect the data from the problem **to your uknowns**! 
    2. You're not done with this step until you have used all of the data in a way that connects it to the unknowns, or until you have a clear path to the solution. Sometimes there's bogus extra data you don't need, so once you can see the solution you are done.
4. Now connect the equations you discovered in order to find a solution. Remember that equations with two variables that aren't raised to powers are always going to give you lines, and there are three ways that multiple lines can interact:
    1. They can cross at one point, which is when you have a single solution
    2. The can be parallel and overlapping, which is when you have infinite solutions
    3. They can be parallel and separate, which is when there are no solutions.
