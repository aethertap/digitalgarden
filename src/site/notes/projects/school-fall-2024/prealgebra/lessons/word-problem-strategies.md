## Concept summary and connections

### part 1
- word problems 
- identifying important data from word problems 
- identifying relationships from word problems 
- Creating expressions from word problems 

### part 2
- Connecting multiple equations in order to solve for multiple variables
    - need at least one independent equation per variable, or can't solve
    - Each equation is a line if you graph it, and they have to intersect in a point in order to have a unique solution
    - parallel and overlapping lines have zero and infinite solutions respectively

## Worked examples

- You sold 90 donuts altogether
- Jelly donuts are $7, and plain are $4
- If you made $399, how many of each type did you sell?
- What kind of donut brought in more money?

1. let x = the number of jelly donuts sold
2. let y = the number of plain donuts sold

$$
\begin{align} \\

x + y &= 90 &\text{given} \\ 
7x &= \text{money from jelly donuts} & \text{given} \\
4y &= \text{money from plain donuts} & \text{given} \\
7x+4y &= 399 &\text{given, total is sum of parts from each kind} \\
y &= 90 -x & \text{subtraction Property of Equality, from (2)} \\
7x + 4(90-x) &= 399 &\text{substitution property of equality} \\
7x + 360 - 4x &= 399 &\text{distributive property} \\
3x &= 39 & \text{subtraction property of equality} \\
x &= 13 \text{ jelly donuts} & \text{division property of equality} \\
13 + y &= 90 & \text{substitution property of equality} \\
y &= 73 \text{ plain donuts} & \text{subtraction property of equality} \\
\end{align}
