## Concept summary and lesson


- repeating decimals 
- dividing by 9 
- writing a fraction with a denominator that's a power of 10 to round it 
    - Multiply top and bottom by fraction so that denominator becomes 10, 100, etc.
    - Look at the numerator for the digits to that place value, and the fractional part tells you directly if it's a round-up or keep situation ($\geq \frac{1}{2}$?)
- adding and subtracting repeating decimals 
    - just be careful to align digits
    - Carrying and borrowing can get downright weird: ($0.\overline{9}=1)$

## Worked examples

- [ ] What fraction in simplest form is equal to $0.92\overline{23}$?  
- [ ] How much bigger is $0.\overline{473}$ than $0.47$? Express answer as fraction.
