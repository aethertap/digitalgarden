## Concept summary and lesson

- In problems where there are a bunch of constraints that whittle away possible answers, it's sometimes handy to just write them down and cross them off. 
- Sometimes there just aren't that many possible answers. That's another time when writing them down and filtering them out is fast and convenient.
- When you're going to make a list, **try to start with the most restrictive property** because it will give you the smallest set of things at the beginning.

Remember: Getting the correct answer is the goal here, not proving you can do hard work. If you have a clever way to get it done, just *use it* (as long as it's actually *you* doing the work, not just looking up the answer or asking AI...).

## Guided practice


- [ ] Elizabeth spent exactly $\$7$ for some $15$-cent stamps and some $31$-cent stamps. How many $15$-cent stamps did she buy?   
- [ ] Find a two-digit positive integer with all these properties:
    - the tens digit is larger than the ones digit (units digit),
    - the difference between the digits is greater than 3,
    - the sum of the digits is greater than 10, and 
    - the integer is a multiple of 12.   
- [ ] A partition of a positive integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as the sum of positive integers in which the order of the numbers in the sum doesnâ€™t matter. For example, the partitions of 3 are 3, $2+1$, and $1+1+1$. We consider $2+1$ and $1+2$ to be the same, so there are 3 partitions of 3. How many partitions of 6 are there?
