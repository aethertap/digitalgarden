## Concept summary and connections

- solving inequalities 
- simplfiying equations 
- mixed-number arithmetic 
- algebra with inequalities

## Worked examples

- Inequalities work like equations, with a small but important difference
- Multiplying both sides by a negative number **switches the direction of the inequality**
    - The *size* of the number doesn't change, but the one that was *more positive* is now *more negative*, or vice versa
    - Adding, subtracting, and multiplying by positive numbers keeps the inequality unchanged
    - Raising both sides to a power can be tricky, **pay close attention to the signs!** $-\frac{1}{2} < \frac{1}{4}$  but $\left( -\frac{1}{2}\right)^2=\frac{1}{4} > \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^2=\frac{1}{16}$
