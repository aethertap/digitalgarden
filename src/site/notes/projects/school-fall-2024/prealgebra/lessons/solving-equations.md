## Concept summary and connections


- properties of equality 
- transitive property of equality 

## Worked examples

$\frac{1}{10}+\frac{2}{100}+\frac{3}{1000}+\frac{x}{10000}+\frac{2}{100000}=\frac{12372}{100000}$

$\frac{4}{5}=\frac{x}{25}=\frac{60}{y}$, find $\frac{x}{y}$

four more than triple a number equals ten less than five times the number $3x+4 = 5x-10$
