## Concept summary and lesson


- Decimals, Repeating decimals, comparing 
- How to compare repeating decimals 
- identifying the repeating unit 

## Worked examples

- Put these numbers in order from least to greatest: $1.2345, 1.234\overline{5}, 1.23\overline{45}, 1.2\overline{345}, 1.\overline{2345}$ 
    - We need to get an extra digit so we can compare them, they're all identical up to the displayed point!

- Express $\dfrac{.\overline{48}}{.\overline{15}}$ as a mixed number in simplest terms.
    - $0.\overline{48} = \frac{48}{99}$ and $0.\overline{15} = \frac{15}{99}$, so the total fraction is $\frac{\frac{48}{99}}{\frac{15}{99}}$ 
    - Multiply by $\frac{99}{99}$: $\frac{48}{15}$
    - simplify: $\frac{48}{15}=3 \frac{3}{15} = 3 \frac{1}{5}$
