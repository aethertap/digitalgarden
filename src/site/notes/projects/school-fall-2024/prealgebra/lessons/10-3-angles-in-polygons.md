## Concept summary and lesson


- interior angles 
- exterior angles 
- sum of interior angles 
- sum of exterior angles 
- convex vs concave 
- obtuse, right, and acute triangles 
- regular polygon 

Polygons are composed of *vertices* (singular: *vertex*), and *sides*. Each pair of sides meets at a vertex, and they form an angle that is not a straight angle.
### Definitions

- **Interior angle**: An angle measured between adjacent sides of a polygon on the *inside* of the polygon
- **Exterior angle**: An angle measured between adjacent sides of a polygon on the *outside* of the polygon
- **convex polygon**: A polygon whose interior angles are all *less than 180*. You can think of it as a polygon with no "dents" poking into its interior. If you stretched a rubber band around a convex polygon, it would touch all of the vertices.
- **concave polygon**: A polygon with at least one interior angle *greater than 180*. These have a dent. A rubber band stretched around a concave polygon would skip over at least one vertex.

### Some angle properties

- the sum of interior angles of any triangle is always 180$\degree$
- The sum of interior angles of any quadrilateral is always $360\degree$
- In general, the sum of the interior angles of any n-sided polygon is $180(n-2)\degree$
- The sum of *exterior* angles of any polygon is always $360\degree$


## Guided practice

- [ ] Show that the angles in a quadrilateral must always add up to 360$\degree$  
- [ ] Show that the *exterior* angles of any convex polygon add up to $360\degree$
