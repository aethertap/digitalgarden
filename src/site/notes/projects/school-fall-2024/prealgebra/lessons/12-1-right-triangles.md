## Concept summary and lesson


- The pythagorean theorem 
    - $a^2+b^2 = c^2$ , where $a,b,c$ are the lengths of the sides of a right triangle
  
- Find a missing side length for a right triangle 
    - if $a = 12$ and $c=13$, what is $b$?
    - if $a=2$ and $b=2$, what is $c$?
    - if $c = 2a$, what is $b$?
- hypotenuse and legs of right triangle 
    - The hypotenuse is always longer than either leg, but shorter than the sum of the legs. Why?
- Can a right triangle be isosceles? Equilateral? Obtuse? Acute? 
    - draw pictures. Check in with the pythagorean theorem, use logic.
- Rectilinear paths and displacement. 
    - If I follow a path that goes north 5, then east 2, then north 10, then west 3, how for *north* and *east* am I from where I started?
    - What is my *distance* from where  I started?

## Guided practice

- [ ] Set up the problem above by labeling all of the parts of the diagram with either numbers or variable names, and writing down any equations that you think will help.  
- [ ] Use the two-column format to solve the problem.  

## Homework

- [ ] #hw (math) (gr7) Read section 12.1 The Pythagorean Theorem (p. 442) and do problems [[2025-03-20\|2025-03-20]]
