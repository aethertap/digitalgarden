## Concept summary and connections


- Picking the right unknowns for a word problem 
- Deciding which unknowns to solve for first 
- Howto combine equations in order to solve them. 
- Adding and subtracting equations 
- Isolating a variable ("solving for it") 

## Worked examples

Vera and Vikki are sisters. Vera is 4 years old and Vikki is 13 years old. What age will each sister be when Vikki is twice as old as Vera?

What's the data?
- Vera is 4
- Vikki is 13
- at some point, Vikki will be twice Vera's age

What's the unknown?
- What age will they be when Vikki is double Vera's age?

How do you pick the unkown?
- This one is tricky - it's not any of the named parts! Start by making an expression for each sister's age after some amount of time:
- let a = Vikki's age
- let b = Vera's age
- Vera's age after $n$ years is $4+n$
- Vikki's age after $n$ years is $13+n$
- Notice we have another variable: $n$, which is the number of years

We're looking for the time when $a = 2b$, but $a$ and $b$ depend on n...
What about solving for $n$?

$2(4+n) = 13+n$
$2n+8 = n+13$
$n = 5$

So, Vikki will be twice Vera's age in 5 years, or when she is 18 and Vera is 9.

For this problem, they never actually asked for the right unknown. We had to *figure out* what it was by *exploring* the problem.

## Guided practice


- [ ] A plane traveled 480 miles each way to Roanville and back. The trip there was with the wind and took 3 hours. The trip back was into the wind and took 4 hours. What is the speed of the plane in still air? What is the speed of the wind?   
- [ ] When we add three consecutive integers together, the result is 21. What are the integers?
