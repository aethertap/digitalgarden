## Worked examples

### Converting decimals to fractions:

First, do you recognize it? if so, you're done!

But, if you *don't* recognize it:
1. Write the decimal number as a whole number fraction with a power of ten in the denominator
2. Simplify the fraction

Example: Write 0.25 as a fraction

$$
\begin{align} \\
0.25 &= 2\cdot 10^{-1} + 5 \cdot 10^{-2} \\
&= \frac{2}{10}+\frac{5}{100} \\
&= \frac{20}{100}+\frac{5}{100} \\
&= \frac{25}{100} &\text{definition of decimal}\\
&= \frac{5}{20} & \text{common factor 4} \\
&= \frac{1}{4} & \text{common factor 5}
\end{align}
$$

### Converting fractions to decimals

First, do you already know it? If so, you're done! It's worth memorizing a bunch of common ones!

But, if you *don't* recognize it, the answer is simply to use long division and stop when you have enough digits to round to the correct place value. 
Example: Write $\frac{3}{7}$ as a decimal to the hundredths place:

Use long division to compute 3 divided by 7 out to the *thousandths* place (one place value more than what you're looking for! It's important for rounding!)
1. Result: $0.428$
2. Now round to the hundredths place: $0.43$

### Shortcut trick for making decimals from fractions (sometimes)

Sometimes, you can see a way to make the denominator into a power of ten easily. If you can do that, then you can just change the fraction's denominator to a power of ten and read off the decimal answer! 

Example: Convert $1 \frac{3}{5}$ to a decimal:
1. The whole-number part doesn't change, so we can just ignore it for now.
2. Notice that $5\cdot 20 = 100$, so $\frac{3}{5} \frac{20}{20} = \frac{60}{100} = \frac{6}{10}$
3. The decimal part is $\frac{6}{10}=0.6$, so the answer is 1.6!
