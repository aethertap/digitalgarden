## Increase and decrease

When you have a problem that is talking about percent increase or decrease, the thing you have to keep in mind is simple: You always start with the *current amount* and the increase or decrease is the **percentage of the original amount, that gets added or subtracted from the original**.

$\text{new amount }=\text{old amount } + \text{old amount } \times \text{percent change}$

With that equation, you can always find any of the three quantities (new amount, old amount, or percent change). Which one you solve for depends on how the question is asked!

If the problem says it *decreased by a percent*, then the percent change is negative.

### A shortcut that is handy sometimes

Notice that we can factor the right hand side of the equation:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{new amount }&=\text{old amount } + \text{old amount } \times \text{percent change} \\
&= \text{old amount} \times (1+\text{ percent change})
\end{align}
$$
That means that an increase will multiply by a number a bit bigger than one, and a decrease will multiply by one that's a bit smaller than one.

- **Decrease** $x$ by 10% means the same thing as $(1-0.1)x=0.9x$
- **Increase** x by 10% means the same thing as $(1+0.1)x = 1.1x$
