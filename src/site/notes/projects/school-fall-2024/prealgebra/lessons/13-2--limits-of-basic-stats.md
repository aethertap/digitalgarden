## Concept summary and lesson


- Average, Median, and Mode are useful, but there are many things they can't tell us. 
- Average doesn't tell us anything about "fairness" of distribution. 
- Median doesn't tell us anything about total wealth or extreme values. 
- Mode is pretty useless in general, I don't know why it's still taught.

- [ ] The average wealth of a person in Richville is $\$150,\!000$ and the average wealth of a person in Poorville is $\$20,\!000$.   
    - Suppose a person is called “filthy stinking rich” if the person has over one million dollars. Can we tell which town has more filthy stinking rich people?
    - Can we tell which town has the higher median wealth?
    - If both towns have the same number of people, can we tell which town has the higher total wealth?
    - Suppose a person with $\$1,\!000,\!000$ and 4 people who have $\$0$ move into Richville. Will the average wealth of Richville go up or down? 

- [ ] The median wealth of a person in Goldtown is $\$150,\!000$ and the median wealth of a person in Tintown is $\$20,\!000$. Each town has $8000$ people. 
    - Suppose a town qualifies for special government subsidies if each of at least half of its residents has less than $\color[rgb]{0.11,0.21,0.37}\$60{,}000$. Does either town necessarily qualify for the subsidies?
    - Can we tell which town has the higher average wealth?
    - Suppose a person with $1,000,000,000 and four people with $0 move into town. Will the median wealth go up or down?
