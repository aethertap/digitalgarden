## Concept summary and lesson

- Inverse operations 
- squares and square roots 
- $\sqrt{x}$ is the *positive* value by definition, even though there is a matching negative! 
- We're not going to take the square root of any negative numbers for now, because that would just be un*imagine*able...
- Since the square root like this is *defined* to be the positive number, we have to explicitly state that we want both positive and negative when that's the case. We do that by writing it with the $\pm$ symbol (`\pm` in latex): $x = \pm \sqrt{17 }$ for example

## Worked examples

When we're calculating square roots without a calculator, it really pays to get good at estimating. 

Example: Simplify $\sqrt{ 65536 }$ 
1. First, notice that this is close to 64000, which we can break into $64\times 1000$
2. $64=8^2$, and $1000 \approx 33^2$, so we can say $\sqrt{ 65536 }\approx 8\times 33$
3. Now divide by $8\times 33=264$: $65536 \div 264 \approx  248$, so our number is a bit big
4. We can zero in by picking the middle value and trying again: $\frac{{264+248}}{2}=256$
5. In this case, we got the answer! $65536 = 256^2$ 

The key steps:
1. Estimate the approximate size of the answer by ignoring the small place-values and picking a square that's close to what you're looking for
2. Look at the digits: the ones' place will tell you what the possible answer digits are (if it's a perfect square - if not, you will know because there's no square with the right ones' place).
3. Divide by your guess, and use the difference to zero in on the answer. A good starting point is to pick the average of the two numbers for each step.
