## Concept summary and lesson

Square roots have a few rules of engagement that you need to understand. When you get them down, they'll let you solve problems more easily. Here's what you need to know:

### Products (and quotients) of square roots

You can multiply square roots, by just multiplying what's *in* the square root:

$\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ ab }$

Naturally, you can use this in reverse, dividing out factors of expressions into their own square root terms. This is pretty handy for calculating square roots of long numbers:

What is $\sqrt{ 0.000169 }$?

$$
\begin{align}
\sqrt{ 0.000169 } &= \sqrt{ 0.000001}\sqrt{ 169 } & \text{Multiplication of square roots} \\
&= \sqrt{ \frac{1}{1000000} }\sqrt{ 169 } & \text{Equivalent fraction} \\
&= \frac{1}{1000}\sqrt{ 169 } & \text{Square root of fraction is square root of parts} \\
&= \frac{1}{1000} 13 = \frac{13}{1000}=0.013 & \text{squre root of 169=13}
\end{align} 
$$

### Sums and differences of square roots

Unfortunately, ***we can't do the same things with sums and differences.*** That is, $\sqrt{ a + b } \ne \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}$

To see why, all we have to do is work with the equation a bit:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Assume }\sqrt{ a+b } = \sqrt{ a } + \sqrt{ b}: \\
\sqrt{ a+b } &= \sqrt{ a } + \sqrt{ b} & \text{Assumed} \\
(\sqrt{ a+b })^2 &= (\sqrt{ a }+\sqrt{ b })^2 & \text{squaring property of equality} \\
a+b &= (\sqrt{ a }+\sqrt{ b })^2 & \text{Definition of square root} \\
&= (\sqrt{ a }+\sqrt{ b })(\sqrt{ a }+\sqrt{ b }) & \text{squaring} \\
&= (\sqrt{ a })^2 + \sqrt{ a } \sqrt{ b } +\sqrt{ b }\sqrt{ a } + (\sqrt{ b })^2 & \text{distributive property}  \\
&= a + b + 2\sqrt{ a }\sqrt{ b } & \text{reorder terms} \\
a+b &\ne a + b + 2\sqrt{ a }\sqrt{ b } & \text{contradiction, unless a,b=0}
\end{align}
$$


## Guided practice


- [ ] Evaulate $\sqrt{ 11 \frac{1}{9} }$
- [ ] For what integer n is $\sqrt{4}\cdot \!\sqrt{25} = \!\sqrt{n}$  
- [ ] Is $\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2}=5+12$?  
- [ ] Is $\sqrt{4} + \sqrt{9} = \sqrt{13}$?   
- [ ] Prove that $\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b} \ne \sqrt{a+b}
