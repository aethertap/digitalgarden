## Concept summary and lesson


- Mean (Average) - If you made all values identical, what would you have to pick so that the total remains the same? This is the average. 
- Median - Pick the value from the set that's in the middle when you put them in order. The median is the value that has the same number of things greater and less than its own value. 
- Mode - what happens the most? Pick the value that happens more times than any other value. Sometimes, there is no mode. 

## Guided practice

- [ ] Suppose you average 82 on your first 7 tests in a class. What must you score on the eighth test to raise your average to 84?   
- [ ] In their first 6 games, the Sixers averaged 81 points. In their next 4 games, the Sixers averaged 73 points.  
    - [ ] (a) What is the Sixersâ€™ average score for all 10 games?  
    - [ ] (b) What must the Sixers average in their next 5 games so that 80 will be their average score over all 15 games?
