## Concept summary and connections


- Logical combinations of inequality expressions 
- Using interval notation and number lines to resolve conditions 

## Worked examples

## Guided practice


- [ ] if a >= b and b >=c, is a > c?  
- [ ] if a <= b and c <= b, is a <= c?  
- [ ] Draw the components of each expression on the number line as intervals and see if the overlap
