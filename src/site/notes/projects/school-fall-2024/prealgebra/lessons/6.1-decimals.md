## Worked examples

### Homework Review

Inequalities gave some serious trouble, let's do some together:
1. assume $a > b > c > d$
    1. is $a+c > b+d$ ?
    2. is $a+d > b+c$ ?
    3. is $ac > bd$ ?
    4. is $ab > cd$ ?

Things to try: 
- What if some or all of them are negative?
- Write variables as e.g. $a^+$ or $b^-$:
    - is $b^++d^+ > b + d$? both numbers on the left are greater, so the sum is greater
    - is $a+d > b+c$ ? Rewrite it as $b^+ + c^- > b + c$ ? Could be either way, one number is bigger and the other is smaller.
