- proportional assignment of ratio parts
- Converting ratios to fractions 
- ratios with fractions and mixed numbers 

## Worked examples

Working with ratios is tricky until your realize two things:

1. They're just fractions of a common denominator
2. You have to **add all of them up** in order to get the shared denominator.

Ratios are a kind of short hand for writing a bunch of related fractions all in a group. Example: You and three friends shared $240 in the ratio 1:2:4:5. How much money did each person get?

What that $1:2:4:5$ means is that you divided the money into enough equal-sized pieces so that you could give that number of pieces to each person. $1+2+4+5=12$, so in order to share the money like this, you need to split it into $\frac{1}{12}$ sized shares.

Then, you just give each person the number of shares equal to their part of the ratio:$\frac{1}{12} : \frac{2}{12} : \frac{4}{12} : \frac{5}{12}$. Since we have $240, one share is $\frac{1}{12} * 240 = 20$, so the proportional shares of the money work out to $20, $40, $80, $100.

### Other useful ways to look at ratios

Ratios are indeed fractions, but we can also think of them as *proportions* and skip the denominator for some kinds of problems. Let's say we know that Gus gets twice as many dog treats as Maggie. We can write the ratio of $Gus : Maggie$ dog treats as $2 : 1$. 

Now we can answer questions like *If Maggie got 17 treats, how many did Gus get?* We know that he got two treats for every one of hers, so we can multiply her treat count by $\frac{2}{1}$ and get 34. This still works if the numbers aren't so nice: Say we have a recipe that requires a ratio of $oil:vinegar$ that's $3:4$. We measured 7 oz of vinegar, how much oil do we need? Well, we know that for every *four* ounces of vinegar, we need *three* ounces of oil. We know that we have $\frac{7}{4}$ portions of "four ounces of vinegar" (divide the amount by four, that gives how many four-ounce portions we have). Now we know that *for each of those, we need three ounces of oil*. That phrase suggest that we need to multiply the number of vinegar portions by three to get the amount of oil: $3 \cdot \frac{7}{4}=\frac{21}{4}=5 \frac{1}{4}$ 

***What did we do there?*** Since we know the amount for one of the ratio parts, we can see *what we have to multiply the ratio number by to get the result*. It's like a recipe - If you're making a double batch, you mutiply every measure by two. Well, if you have to make a $\frac{7}{4}$ batch, you multiply every measure by $\frac{7}{4}$! If you know one ingredient, find its multiple and then use it to figure out the rest.

The oil and vinegar could also have been solved with fractions: 
- Let the total amount of the mixture we make be $x$
- We know that there are 7 total parts ($3 \text{ oil }+4 \text{ vinegar}$), so the total mix is $\frac{4}{7}$ vinegar and $\frac{3}{7}$ oil. 
- We know that there are 7 oz vinegar, so $7 = \frac{4}{7}x$
- In order to find the oil, we want to know what $\frac{3}{7}x$ will be

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{4}{7}x &= 7\\ \\
4x &= 49 & \text{multiplicative Property of Equality} \\ 
x &= \frac{49}{4} & \text{division property of equality} \\
x &= 12 \frac{1}{4} 
\end{align}
$$

So we know there are $12 \frac{1}{4}$ oz all together. That means that there must be $12 \frac{1}{4} - 7=5 \frac{1}{4}$ ounces of oil. Good thing we got the same answer!
