## Concept summary and lesson


- A line crossing parallel lines makes equal corresponding angles. 
- parallel lines are lines that are not in the same place and will never cross. 

## Worked examples

Parallel lines are lines in the same plane that will never cross. When another line crosses parallel lines, you get a lot of equal angles. The easiest way to think about this is with the *vertical angle* theorem we proved last time - the angles on opposite sides of the crossing point of two crossing lines are equal. With parallel lines, **all of the crossing points** are the same! That means that angles in corresponding positions on any of the intersections are all equal. This is true no matter how many parallel lines you have.

### Useful trick

When you're dealing with problems involving angles and lines, *adding extra parallel lines* is often helpful in order to see the relationships more clearly, because it will immediately tell you what all of the angles are for corresponding intersections.

## Guided practice


- [ ] Draw a line that crosses parallel lines, and measure the angles with a protractor. Which angles are equal?  
- [ ] A chicken starts on one side of the road, crossing at a 22 degree angle. At some point, it gets distracted and turns so that the acute angle in its path is 71 degrees. What is the acute angle formed when the chicken crosses to the other side of the road now?
