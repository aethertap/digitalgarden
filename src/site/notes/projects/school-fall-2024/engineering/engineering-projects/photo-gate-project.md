# Building a Photo Gate for Physics

Lesson Plan: [[projects/school-fall-2024/engineering/lessons/photo-gate-design\|photo-gate-design]]

A photogate is a device that uses a beam of light to record a precise measurement of when an object passes through the gate. We're going to need these for our physics labs soon, so we need to build a few of them.

Problems to solve:
- Connecting multiple gates to the same arduno
- Adjusting sensitivity/calibrating the output
- Mechanical design to hold the sensor and LED, as well as the mounting hardware and wires.

- [x] #hw (engr) Design the photogate circuit and implement it with breadboard and arduino [[2025-01-07\|2025-01-07]]
- [ ] #hw (engr) Measure all components for our photo-gate project (LED, phototransistor, wires, threaded rod, connector body, etc. [[daily/2025-01-14\|2025-01-14]]
- [ ] #hw (engr) Design a very simple enclosure to hold our components and make it easy to connect the Arduino. What kind of connector body should we use? [[daily/2025-01-14\|2025-01-14]]
- [x] #hw (engr) Switch arduino code to use `analogRead` and set the sensitivity so it can detect our LEDs [[2025-01-09\|2025-01-09]]
- [ ] #hw (engr) Print out the prototype mount and assemble everything. Connect it to the arduino and do a test run.
- [ ] #hw (engr) Correct any problems with the design, then print four working photogates.
