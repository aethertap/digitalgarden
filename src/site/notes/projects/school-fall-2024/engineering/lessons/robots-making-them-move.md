## Lesson Content

Today we do final assembly and testing on our bots. We're going to have to do some custom connector work to get the LiFePO batteries hooked up to the arduino, but from there on it should be easy street.

Get your wires hooked up, double check connections and pin numbers, then we're going to see about making these things move.

## Practice


- [x] #hw (engr) Connect the servos and battery to the arduino  [[2025-02-04\|2025-02-04]]
- [x] #hw (engr) Test the drive method, should go forward and backward  [[2025-02-04\|2025-02-04]]
