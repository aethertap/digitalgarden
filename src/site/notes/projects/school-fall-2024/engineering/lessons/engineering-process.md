## Concept summary and connections


- stages of engineering design 
- concept generation 
- prototyping 
- discovering requirements 
- defining the problem 

Design proposal basics:
- What's the problem?
- What are the discovered requirements that will solve the problem if they are met?
- What is the proposed solution?
- How long will it take to build?
- How much will it cost?
- What are future options we might take that didn't make the cut this time, but might make it as we learn more about the problem?
- What will the prototype do in order to prove the concept?
- How quickly can we have the prototype ready?

Once we have a concept, we should try to prototype it as quickly as possible. In the case of the photogate, we have the circuit and a bit of code, so we have already done part of the prototyping. We need to make it into a device that can detect when an object passes through, so what could we build **today** that would show that working? We could use cardboard, plywood, construction foam, hot glue, etc. 

## Example Proposal: Cranial thermal regulation device

### Problem Statement

In weather with temperatures below about 30$\degree$ F, many people will experience chilling of the skin on the head and ears. This is uncomfortable, and we will create a device that will help alleviate this discomfort.

### Requirements

- The device must help keep the head and ears warm even in very cold weather
- The device must be comfortable enough to use for long periods
- The device must be cleanable, as contact with skin will inevitably leave it dirty

### Proposed solution

We will create a specially-shaped blanket, designed to fit over the top of the head snugly enough to keep itself in place, but not so snugly as to cause discomfort. The blanket material will be a knitted fabric that is both elastic and highly insulating, and it will be dense enough to block moderate breezes.

The initial prototype will be complete within an hour, as all that is required is to wrap a piece of the material around the head and check to see that it does indeed keep the noggin toasty. The prototype will allow us to ensure that the device works as expected, and it will also help us finalize some of the choices for design options that did not make the cut this time. Once the concept is proven, creation of a finished device will take around two hours.

Cost: Total cost of materials will be approximately $4. Cost of engineering time will be approximately $10,000, with flexibility for additional design effort as needed.

Some additional design options were considered during this process. If this design is found to be inadequate, we may try some of the following:
- make the sides long enough to cuff once, in order to double the thickness over the ears
- Add some decorative tassles for extra rizz.
- Add a chin strap for use in very windy conditions
- Add a semi-rigid brim above the eyes to help shade from bright light, such as that put off by the Sun.
