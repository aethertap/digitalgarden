### Lesson-specific resource links

- [ ] #hw Read [Dire wolves brought back from extinction](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/dire-wolves-return-after-13000-years) and write an ACE response to the question: Should humans bring extinct animals back to life? [[2025-04-16\|2025-04-16]]

## Concept summary and connections

- Simplifying code makes it easier to debug 
- Finding minimal test cases, setting up debug runs 

## Homework

- [ ] #hw (engr) Make a test function in your code that runs your bot through some basic movement and sensing checks so that you can quickly make sure everything still works after a change is made.  [[2025-04-10\|2025-04-10]]
