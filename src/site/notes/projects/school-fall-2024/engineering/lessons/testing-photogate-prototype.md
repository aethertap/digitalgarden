- product testing 
- design iteration 

## Lesson

Today we are going to put the [[projects/school-fall-2024/engineering/engineering-projects/photo-gate-project\|photo-gate-project]] test protocols into action. Each gate will be tested to make sure it meets criteria. If it does, we will move on to building the first real instance of each gate using onshape.

## Practice

- [x] #hw (engr) Using onshape, design a 3D-printable photogate that accounts for any problems we discovered with our prototypes.  [[2025-01-23\|2025-01-23]]
