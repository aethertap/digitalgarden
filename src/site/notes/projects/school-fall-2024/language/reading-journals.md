# Reading Journals

We will be continuously reading for the rest of our school careers! The idea is that we will be reading *every day* and taking notes, on whatever books seem interesting.

## Sections

### Graffiti

This page is for quotes you loved, and for small doodles that remind you of scenes you thought were really impactful, or events in the book you really want to remember.

### Stuff I Want to Read

This is a list of books... that you want to read... for this project...

Use the Genre Histogram (next section) to make sure you have a mix of things.


### Genre Histogram

We'll have a table here with rows for books and columns for genres. The goal of this project is to get a pretty even distribution of things we've read and written about.

### Current book notes

You'll have a lot of these, one for each book you read. This is where you write your thoughts after your day's reading. Practice formulating clear, complete thoughts and getting them into words that express your whole meaning. Use complete sentences with interesting variation in the sentence type and structure.

This is your place to write things you like, dislike, or have any other kinds of feelings about with respect to the book. It's where you write down the thoughts the book inspires in you about other parts of life, or ideas that you get while reading. It's your space to see where the book takes you, but the purpose is to practice *writing about what you think*.

Requirements:

- All writing must be complete sentences with correct punctuation and grammar.
- Thoughts that require more than a sentence should be organized into a coherent paragraph (or multiple paragraphs for really big ideas!).
- Paragraphs need to have a strong topic sentence and a good conclusion.
- Sentences within the paragraph must all relate to the topic.
- Quotes from the book must have page numbers so you can find them again.
- ***EVERY*** reading session needs to have a thoughtful entry in this file, there's no such thing as saying, "I didn't really have any thoughts about this part."
