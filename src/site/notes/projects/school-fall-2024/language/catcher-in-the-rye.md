# Book Study of The Catcher in the Rye

We will be reading *The Catcher in the Rye* over the next four weeks ([[2025-01-28\|2025-01-28]] through [[2025-02-25\|2025-02-25]]). Each week, we'll discuss the reading that was due, and go over annotations, outline, and any vocabulary or other language features we think need some attention.

## Weekly Discussion Prep

Every week, the following things will be due at the same time as the reading:

- A brief (one paragraph) summary of what happened in the story since the last discussion
- Your thoughts and reactions about *what the story means to you* - this is a great book for a reason, it has deeper meaning than just the story itself, so try to figure it out
- A list of at least three uncommon or unfamiliar words from the text, with definitions.
- An updated outline of the story that will be used to write your final book report.

## Book report

At the end of the reading, you'll have a week to write a book report. The rough draft will be due on that Tuesday, and the final draft on that Thursday.

- gr7: The book report should be at least 500 words and should be your best writing. See the [[projects/school-fall-2024/language/book-report-rubric\|book-report-rubric]] for details about content.
- gr10: The book report should be at least 1000 words and should be your best writing. See the [[projects/school-fall-2024/language/book-report-rubric\|book-report-rubric]] for details about content.
