# Using *The Writing Revolution*

Key themes:
- Writing should be integrated into every subject
- Sentences are the foundation of all writing
- The most important stages of writing are planning and revising
- Grammar should be taught in context of student writing, not separately.
- Writing is a powerful learning tool for any subject when it's embedded well
- Students need explicit instruction in writing, even if they are avid readers.

Instead of working on detailed syntactic knowledge of parts of speech, this approach focuses on the functions they have within a sentence. It simplifies the approach to thinking about *appositives* (noun modifiers), *coordinating conjunctions*, and other things that have very clear roles.

## Sentence Activities

- Fragment or Sentence? (p. 38 for details)
    - Take sentences about current study topic and remove all capitalization and punctuation, then turn some of them into fragments.
    - Students identify which are fragments, and correct all sentences (including content, and patching up fragments)
- Unscramble scrambled sentences (p. 41 for details)
    - Scramble the words and remove capitalization and punctuation in sentences either from lesson material or about it
    - Students rebuild correct sentences (both content and structure)
- Correcting run-ons (p. 42)
    - Convert a string of sentences into a preposterous run-on and put it on the board every day. 
    - Students split it into independent sentences to correct the run-on
    - Try to ID the typical joining syntax they use and have them search for that (comma, "and", etc) to try to self-correct run-ons

Level 1 students should start expanding sentences using the question words
when, where, and why.
⚫ There should be only one pronoun in a kernel.
Students should write answers to question words in note form on dotted lines
and write their expanded sentences on solid lines.
⚫ Students should begin their expanded sentences with when if it is one of the
question words.
⚫ Students' expanded sentences should not add, delete, or substitute informa-
tion (unless it's replacing a pronoun).
Use sentence expansion activities to help students anticipate what the reader
needs to know.
Use sentence expansion activities to check students' comprehension of
content.
Note-taking is a powerful strategy for gaining and retaining knowledge.
Below mid-third grade, note-taking should be limited to key words and
phrases. After that point, begin to add symbols and abbreviations at your
discretion.
