# Varying Sentence Types

Varying your sentence types can help you make your writing more interesting to the reader, and it can also help you find better ways to communicate your intended message. There are four types to work with:

- Declarative: This is the usual "state the facts, please" kind of sentence.
- Imperative: This sentence makes a request ("do this...") or gives advice ("you should...")
- Interrogative: Ask a question of the reader. These are usually *rhetorical* questions, meaning that you're going to answer it yourself.
- Exclamatory: Express force or a strong emotion, using a exclamation mark. Use these sparingly, but a well placed exclamation is sometimes just the thing you need!
