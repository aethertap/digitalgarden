# Because, But, So

This is an exercise style that makes you think about a statement in three different ways and generate a well-written sentence to express your thoughts. You'll be given a *sentence kernel*, which is a clause that expresses a fact or idea about something we've studied. Your job is to **use that kernel** as the **first clause in three separate sentences**. Each sentence will have one of the three *subordinating conjunctions* from the list (*because, but, so*), followed by a statement of your own that elaborates on the original sentence kernel.

Example:

James Holden famously loves coffee, {because, but, so}...

1. James Holden famously loves coffee, because he grew up with it on Earth and it reminds him of home.
2. James Holden famously loves coffee, but that's not the only liquid he's willing to drink.
3. James Holden famously loves coffee, so having him destroy the coffee maker in a fit of rage was a strong scene that effectively showed just how angry and frustrated he had become.
