## Readings and Examples

[Good explanation of how to differentiate independent clauses and dependent clauses](https://www.butte.edu/departments/cas/tipsheets/grammar/indep_clause.html)
- Using a comma and a coordinating conjunction, the conjunction can't make the second clause depend on information from the first one (otherwise it becomes a dependent clause)

**FANBOYS (_for_, _and_, _nor_, _but_, _or_, _yet_, _so_)**

### Phrases and clauses

Phrases and clauses are both groups of words that work together in a sentence. The difference is that a clause has a subject and a verb—often, a clause could be a sentence if it were all by itself, and when it could be, we call it a **main clause** or an **independent clause**.

**Independent Clause**

An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and verb and expresses a complete thought. An independent clause is a sentence.

>Jim studied in the Sweet Shop for his chemistry quiz.

**Dependent Clause**

A dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and verb but does not express a complete thought. A dependent clause cannot be a sentence. Often a dependent clause is marked by a dependent marker word.

>When Jim studied in the Sweet Shop for his chemistry quiz . . . (What happened when he studied? The thought is incomplete.)

**Subordinate Clause**

Subordinate clauses are just another name for Dependent Clauses. They get their name from the fact that they always start with a subordinating conjunction such as _since_, _because_, _although_, and _while_.
