## Lesson

Transitions make your writing flow, and help your reader keep up with the changing topics as your idea develops. When you read a piece of text and it feels "choppy," or it seems like it was written by a child, it's usually because it's basically a list of unconnected thoughts. That puts a big strain on your working memory, because you can't attach things to each other in order to build up a working model of what's being said, and as a result you'll probably be frustrated by the writing.

There are five basic types of transitions that we'll be working with:
- Time and Sequence
- Illustration
- Change of Direction
- Emphasis
- Conclusion

They all have a place in your writing, and they do the important job of showing your reader how your different ideas work together. Mastering the use of transitions will make your writing stand out.

Here are some examples of the kinds of words we're talking about:

| Transition type     | Examples                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time/Sequence       | first, also, second, in addition, last, before, next, later, finally, after, initially, currently, previously, earlier, soon             |
| Illustration        | for example, as an illustration, for instance, to illustrate, such as, particularly, specifically, in particular                         |
| Change of direction | however, but, even though, in contrast, instead, yet, on the other hand, on the contrary, although                                       |
| Emphasis            | in particular, primarily, certainly, particularly, obviously, moreover, most important, notably, in addition, keep in mind               |
| Conclusion          | in conclusion, consequently, to conclude, finally, in closing, therefore, in summary, thus, clearly, in the end, as a result, ultimately |

### Transition rules

1. When a transition is at the beginning of a sentence, it's followed by a comma. For example, "For example, ...".
2. Time/sequence transitions provide a sequence of events or steps in a process
3. Conclusion transitions express a summary, cause-and-effect relationship, point of view, or solution
4. Illustration transitions give examples, provide details, explain or elaborate on a statement
5. Change of directions signal *contrasting* thoughts
6. Emphasis transitions prove a point or statement, or the reaffirm something previously stated.
