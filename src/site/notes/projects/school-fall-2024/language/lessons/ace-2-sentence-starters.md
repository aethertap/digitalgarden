## Lesson

From the ACE book: Using Sentence Starters, p. 20

Having a library of sentence starters can help you keep your writing from getting stale and repetitive (or, if you rely too much on it, it might have the opposite effect). If you find yourself struggling to start the next sentence, take a look through these options and see if one of them gives you an idea. You don't have to use them *literally as written* (except for the 3d6 challenges...), they're just there to give your gray matter a kick and get you out of a rut.

Each part of the ACE answer method has a style of sentence that makes the most sense. These are just some examples, and you can fall back on them when you're running into trouble getting words on the page.
### 3d6 ACE challenge

You have to answer the question in a well-written short paragraph, but each sentence must be started with a selection from this table chosen at random by rolling 1d6 for each part of the answer. No cheating!

*Rules*:
1. Start by rolling 3d6. These are your numbers, and you can't change them.
2. Assign one die to each column. That will determine what sentence starters you must use for that section of your response.
3. Write your response using those sentence starters! Easy, right?
