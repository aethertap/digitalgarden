### Run-on sentences

Run-on sentences are sentences in which independent clauses are joined without the right connectors. They end up sounding like a disjointed stream-of-consciousness, like what you'd hear if a toddler is telling a story. The most common kind of run-on is a comma splice, which is a sentence where two independent clauses are connected with just a comma.

What are the right connectors, you ask? Well, let me tell you:

- A period. (in other words, make more than one sentence!)
- A semicolon (at last, the true use of this obscure glyph has been revealed)
- A comma **followed by a coordinating conjunction** like and, or, but, etc.
- A comma **followed by a subordinating conjuction** to make a dependent clause (so, therefore, then, etc).

When you run across a run-on in the wild, use one of those strategies to repair it.
