Read 7-13, Catcher in the Rye

## Topics

- Aimlessness, avoiding responsibility
- Looking desperately for a distraction (phone calls, dancing with girls, drinking)
- Sour grapes everywhere (nothing around him is good enough)
- "He's so good it's almost corny. I don't know what I mean by that, but I mean it."
- Watching people through the window
- He's able to see the bad in everyone, but he himself has similar problems that he doesn't see. He's "one of those guys who always sees the worst, you know?" What bad he does see in himself he uses almost as an excuse, or maybe even a badge of honor. 
    - Everyone around me is better than me, so I'm just going to do what I want because it doesn't matter

So far, the whole story is about how Holden is trying to eke out the last little bit of freedom before he goes back to his parents' and faces the consequences of getting kicked out of Pencey. It feels like a kind of "what would you do if the world was ending tomorrow?" scenario, but all of his plans fall apart because of poor execution, or because he's got such a negative attitude.


## The Book Report Essay

We have an essay coming up, so it's time to start thinking about topics and making notes for it. Here are a few possible essay questions:

1. Think about Holden’s vision of the nature of childhood and adulthood. Are the two realms as separate as Holden believes them to be? Where does he fit in?
2. The novel is structured around Holden’s encounters and interactions with other people. Does any pattern seem to emerge, or does anything change in his interactions as the novel progresses? How do Holden’s encounters with adults, children, women, and his peers evolve as the novel progresses?

The most ambiguous encounter in the book is Holden’s night at Mr. Antolini’s apartment. What do you make of Mr. Antolini’s actions? Was he making a pass at Holden?

4. Holden often behaves like a prophet or a saint, pointing out the phoniness and wickedness in the world around him. Is Holden as perfect as he wants to be? Are there instances where he is phony and full of hypocrisy? What do these moments reveal about his character and his psychological problems?
