>On the first day of summer vacation. I was excited to relax and unwind at the
beach with my family. Ate breakfast quickly and dashed to the car. Ready to go!
Riding along in the back seat, the beach suddenly came into view. I couldn't
wait to sink my toes into the sand. We carried all the beach gear to our spot, I
was finally able to relax. I closed my eyes and listened as seagulls squawked
 overhead. Crashing on the shore, I could hear the waves. The sun's rays felt
 warm on my skin. A gentle breeze blew since ruffled my hair. Next to me, my
 brother and teacher planned their sandcastle. We arrived at the beach early the
 sandcastle could be gigantic!
