- "Midday was struck on the clock. The bus was being got onto by passengers. They were being squashed together. A hat was being worn on the head of a young gentleman, which hat was encircled by a plait and not by a ribbon. A long neck was sported by the young gentleman. The man standing next to him was being grumbled at by the latter because of the jostling which was being inflicted on him by him. As soon as a vacant seat was espied by the young gentleman, it was made the object of his precipitate movements and it became sat down upon."
## Lesson, Readings, and Examples

There are two voices we're considering here: active and passive. The main difference is in how the subject and the verb are connected.

In an **Active** voice sentence, the subject **does** what the verb says. They are *active*, making something happen.

In a **Passive** voice sentence, something is **happening to the subject**. They are *passive*, being affected by something else.

Example: *Mary ate the pie.*

This is an active voice sentence, because the subject, *Mary*, is making the verb happen. We could change it to passive voice like this:

*The pie was eaten by Mary*

Notice now that the **pie** is the subject, and the verb is something that's happening to it.

### Signs of passive voice

These signs are clues that we might be reading a passive voice sentence. They aren't a guaranteed proof, but they should make you sus.

- The verb is past tense (past tense, e.g. **helped**)
- There's a helping verb (**be** helped, **was** helped)
- It uses **by** to explain what actually caused the action to happen (The stage hand was helped **by** the audience).
- It's hard to figure out what's actually going on, because passive voice puts the action in reverse of what you expect.

### So what?

Passive voice *usually* makes writing harder to understand, and weakens its impact. It's not always a bad thing, but you should be careful using it. It's easier to follow an idea when the active party comes before the action because you can immediately visualize what's happening, even before the sentence is complete. *The clown honked the horn* tells you at the start that a clown is doing something, and later fills in the details. *The horn was honked by the clown* not only has significantly more words, but it also forces you to remember the details for the entire sentence while you wait for the active party to show up.

So if passive voice is only *usually* a problem, when is it okay? Here's what the BBC says:
- Use it when you don't know who the agent is: 
    - "My dog was released in the night" instead of "Somebody released my dog in the night."
- Use it when it doesn't *matter* who the agent is:
    - "Do you need a ride? No, l will be picked up."
- Use it when the agent is clearly implied:
    - "She found that she was being paid less then her male coworkers." instead of "She found that the company paid her less than her male coworkers."
