## Lesson, Readings, and Examples

- **Indicative mood** verbs communicates facts, opinions, and statements.
- **Imperative mood** verbs give commands
- **Interrogative mood** verbs ask questions
- **Conditional mood** verbs describe what would happen if something else happens
- **Subjunctive mood** verbs express a hypothetical (imaginary) situation, wish, dream, hope, or desire, especially if it's unlikely or impossible. Look for "were" and "if", and for suggestions and considerations.

### Verb Tenses

We all know past, present, and future, but what about simple, perfect, continuous, and perfect continuous??

- **Simple** is the most straightforward use of a verb tense. It doesn't add any new information beyond the verb's meaning.
- **Perfect** is related to some *other point in time*, and is either completed or ongoing. *I have played pathfinder for over five years.* Look for the **have** along with a past-tense verb.
- **Continuous (Progressive)** is used for things that will happen for a while before they're done. *We'll be studying all night for the test*. These usually involve a *be* verb along with the -ing suffix
- **Perfect Continuous** is a thing that will continue for a time, and that started at some other time. *I will have been flying kites for sixteen hours by the end of the day"

| **Simple**             | _I_ **_helped_** _my neighbor yesterday._                                                                                                     | _I_ **_help_** _my neighbor every day._                         | _I_ **_will help_** _my neighbor tomorrow._                                       |
| **Perfect**            | _I_ **_had helped_** _my neighbor clean his attic before I fixed his car._                                                                    | _I_ **_have helped_** _my neighbor too much this week._         | _I_ **_will have helped_** _my neighbor a hundred times by the end of the month._ |
| **Continuous**         | _I_ **_was helping_** _my neighbor when he [brought](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/commonly-confused-words/brought-vs-bought/) me iced tea._ | _I_ **_am helping_** _my neighbor while he fixes up his house._ | _I_ **_will be helping_** _my neighbor next month when he moves._                 |
| **Perfect continuous** | _I_ **_had been helping_** _my neighbor for a year before he finally thanked me._                                                             | _I_ **_have been helping_** _my neighbor since I moved in._     | _I_ **_will have been helping_** _my neighbor for a year next month._             |
### Who Cares? It's all about reaching *agreement*

This matters mostly so that you can avoid awkward sentences that have "mood shifts."  A mood shift happens when you start a sentence with the verb in one mood, and then switch to a different mood in the same sentence.

> Don' t forget to feed the dogs, and you should take them for a walk.

"Don't forget" is imperative, "should take them" is indicative. Instead, the sentence would be better if you stuck with one mood:

> Don't forget to feed the dogs and take them for a walk.

The verbs in the different parts of your sentences need to **agree** - they should have the same mood and tense, otherwise your sentence is weak or even incorrect.
