## Lesson, Readings, and Examples

From the ACE book: 7 - Compare and Contrast strategy

When you're making an argument for something being better or worse than other things, or you're explaning a difficult idea, you can use the compare and contrast strategy for elaboration. With this strategy, you choose something else that the reader is probably familiar with, and use it as a comparison with your topic. You can list how they are similar and different, and by doing that you help the reader build up a better idea of what your point is.

Your sentences will often follow a pattern like this for this strategy:
- Most `___`, but `___`
- Unlike `___`, `___`
- `___` could have `___`, but instead `___`


Example: Who is the most interesting character in the Travelers' Gate series?

Answer: Kai
Cite: refusal to be master, plays with dolls, and is awesome fighter
Elaborate: Most fighters are flat, but Kai has an interesting story

ACE Response: Kai is the most interesting character in *Travelers' Gate* because of the seeming contradictions in his character. Throughout the story, he is a fearsome fighter, but he loves his little wooden dolls and is a terrible mentor. Unlike most powerful secondary characters, Kai's story of refusing to be the master of Vallenhall and choosing a life of obscurity gives his character depth beyond just being a narrative device to eliminate threats for the protagonist.
