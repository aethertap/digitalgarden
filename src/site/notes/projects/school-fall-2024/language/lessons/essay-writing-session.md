Today, we're just going to have a workshop day where you write and I give feedback. By the end of class, we should have drafts for all of the paragraphs of your essay, and you should be ready to work on transitions and sequencing between them.

Goals:
- Turn your support-sentence notes into sentences. Remember that each note doesn't necessarily have to be exactly one sentence. Sometimes you'll wrap a couple notes together into a single sentence, and sometimes you'll realize one of your notes is going to take a bit more than one sentence to explain. This is fine!
- Edit your topic sentences so that the match any changes that spring up from the support sentence construction
- Make concluding sentences that reference the topic or naturally lead in to the next one. Ultimately they should do both.

## Homework

- [x] #hw (lang) Write a draft paragraph for each of your outlined paragraphs. Don't worry too much about transitions yet, just get the skeleton written. [[2025-03-28\|2025-03-28]]
