## Lesson, Readings, and Examples



### Appositives 

An appositive is a noun, or a phrase or clause that works like a noun, that is used to further explain another noun. The only complication you'll likely run into is recognizing the difference between an appositive and a *relative clause*. So, here's the quick explanation:

- An appositive can be removed from a sentence without breaking the sentence's structure
- An appositive is almost always set off with commas and comes after the noun.
- A relative clause starts with a *relative pronoun*: who, which, that, whose whom. Appositives do *not*
- A relative clause has a verb, appositives usually don't.
