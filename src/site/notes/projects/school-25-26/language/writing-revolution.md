# Using *The Writing Revolution*

Key themes:
- Writing should be integrated into every subject
- Sentences are the foundation of all writing
- The most important stages of writing are planning and revising
- Grammar should be taught in context of student writing, not separately.
- Writing is a powerful learning tool for any subject when it's embedded well
- Students need explicit instruction in writing, even if they are avid readers.

Instead of working on detailed syntactic knowledge of parts of speech, this approach focuses on the functions they have within a sentence. It simplifies the approach to thinking about *appositives* (noun modifiers), *coordinating conjunctions*, and other things that have very clear roles.

# Sentence Activities

- Fragment or Sentence? (p. 38 for details)
    - Take sentences about current study topic and remove all capitalization and punctuation, then turn some of them into fragments.
    - Students identify which are fragments, and correct all sentences (including content, and patching up fragments)
- Unscramble scrambled sentences (p. 41 for details)
    - Scramble the words and remove capitalization and punctuation in sentences either from lesson material or about it
    - Students rebuild correct sentences (both content and structure)
- Correcting run-ons (p. 42)
    - Convert a string of sentences into a preposterous run-on and put it on the board every day. 
    - Students split it into independent sentences to correct the run-on
    - Try to ID the typical joining syntax they use and have them search for that (comma, "and", etc) to try to self-correct run-ons

## Sentence Types

Make sure students can use and identify all four sentence types:

- Declarative
- Imperative
- Interrogative
- Exclamatory

Varying the sentence types among these four will help add interest to a piece of writing, and possibly generate some new ideas for how to convey the intended message.  
 
## Sentence expansion

In this class of exercise, you give them a *kernel sentence*, which is a technically complete sentence that's stripped to the bare essence of what's required. You also give them a few *question words* (who, what, where, when, why, how). Their job is to turn the sentence kernel into a much more developed sentence that answers the question provided question words for the reader.

The process has two phases:
1. Write *notes* that answer the question words. These shouldn't be complete sentences, and they should be written with a shorthand that uses arrows, lines, and other quick symbols to denote common connections between ideas
2. Write the actual *sentence* using the content from the notes.

Example: (in the context of Christopher Columbus) *He crossed the Atlantic ocean.* **who**, **why**, **when**
Example answer: *In 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic ocean in search of a westward route to Asia.*

### Sentence expansion guidelines

- List question words on a wall chart in this order: who, what, when, where, why. and how. 
- Provide kernel sentences that **express complete thoughts but are not commands, questions, or fragments**.
- Level 1 students should start expanding sentences using the question words when, where, and why.
- There should be **only one pronoun in a kernel**.
- Students should write answers to question words in note form on dotted lines and write their expanded sentences on solid lines.
- Students should **begin their expanded sentences with when** if it is one of the question words.
- Students' expanded sentences **should not add, delete, or substitute information** (unless it's replacing a pronoun).
- Use sentence expansion activities to help students anticipate what the reader needs to know.
- Use sentence expansion activities to check students' comprehension of content.
- Note-taking is a powerful strategy for gaining and retaining knowledge.
- Below mid-third grade, note-taking should be limited to key words and phrases. After that point, begin to add symbols and abbreviations at your discretion.

## Because, but, so

Provide a sentence stem on a topic from class. They should complete it in three different ways using because, but, and so. The stem should look something like this:

> Caravanseri were important for the trade along the silk road because ...
> Caravanseri were important for the trade along the silk road,  but ...
> Caravanseri were important for the trade along the silk road,  so ...

Make sure they understand to *write a complete sentence that begins with the fragment*, not make up their own sentence or write a fragment to stick on the end. They should write the *entire thing*.

## Varying sentence structure

This section starts out with recognizing the four kinds of sentences (Declarative, Imperative, Interrogative, Exclamation). All of the exercises in here are way too basic, but there's still value in actually practicing varying sentence structure in real writing.

Two things seem to stand out:
3. Challenge them to write a question that could be an essay question on a test about one of our subjects.
4. Write a paragraph using each sentence type (or some subset of sentence types) once. Forcing them to step out of declarative style in an essay might improve the flow and feel of their writing and free up some ideas at the same time.

## Transitions

***See chart of transitions on p. 89***

*This* is an area where some work will pay off. 

Types of Transitions
- Time and sequence: provide sequence of events, steps in a process
- Conclusion: express a summary, cause-and-effect relationship, point of view, solution
- Illustration: give examples, provide details, explain or elaborate on a statement
- Change of direction: signal contrasting thoughts
- Emphasis: prove a point or statement; reaffirm something previously stated

Start with partial sentences, that either need a transition word, or that have the transition word but are missing the content that follows. After that, move on to sequences of sentences that need to be transitioned into each other.

This would be easy to **combine with sentence kernels and question words to practice scaffolding ideas into flowing paragraphs**.

## Appositives

Another name for a noun, or further explanation of a noun. There are several exercise types:

1. Identify appositives - given a sentence with an appositive, pick out the appositive
2. Matching appositives - exercise knowledge of whatever subject you choose by scrambling a list of nouns and appositives that match them, and have the students unscramble things (word match puzzle)
3. Add an appositive - given a sentence with a clearly marked space to fill, add an appositive appropriate to the noun.
4. Brainstorm appositives - given a noun, brainstorm possible appositives that could apply.
5. Appositive to sentence - given the *appostive*, create a *sentence* around it.
6. Topical - Given a topic, write a sentence with an appositive.

## Sentence-combining

Given a list of short, declarative sentences, use conjunctions and transitions to turn them into a single sentence that expresses all of the ideas.


# Paragraphs

A paragraph is a group of sentences that includes details supporting a specific point. Grade paragraphs on a scale that considers these four things:
- Structure: The sentences are sequenced in a way that ensures clarity for the reader.
- Coherence: The sentences are logically connected with transition words that signal the connection, including indications of change of direction or emphasis.
- Unity: Every sentence supports the main idea of the paragraph
- Well-constructed sentences: The sentences are gramatically correct and clear, and their types and structures vary.

## Single-paragraph outline 

A single-paragraph outline is an outline of one paragraph. The process to create it works like this:

1. Identify topic, audience, and purpose. If there will be many connected paragraphs, the audience will be the same, but the topic and purpose may change.
2. Create a topic sentence that **clearly** expresses the *specific topic* of this paragraph. Vagueness here is not okay.
3. Make a list of supporting details as *notes*, not full sentences. These will become the sentences of the body of the paragraph, but they may not be one-to-one in number.
4. Create a *concluding* sentence that references the main idea but does not restate it. If this is part of a larger piece, it's important for the conclusion to lead into the topic of the next paragraph.

### Exercises

1. Distinguish a topic sentence from details: Given a list of at least three sentences from a paragraph, identify the topic sentence and the details that support it.
2. Identify the T.S. and then put the details in the correct order. Given three or more sentences, first identify which is the topic, then put the paragraph into a logical order with good flow.
3. Given a T.S., select relevant details from a list: The details should include related things that both support and fail to support the main idea. Pick out the good ones.
4. Eliminate irrelevant details from a list
5. Generate details from your own knowledge
6. Practice the three strategies for topic and concluding sentences:
    1. Sentence types
    2. Subordinating conjunctions
    3. Appositives
7. Given a topic or prompt, generate a topic sentence.
8. Given details, generate a topic sentence.
9. Given a topic sentence and details, generate a conclusion sentence
10. Given a topic or prompt, generate a single-paragraph outline independently.

## Text structures

There are several standard "text structures" that are used for different kinds of paragraph. These can be used as the target for a SPO, picked based on the paragraph's purpose.

- Narrative - telling a story about something, or a sequence of events
- Descriptive
- Problem/solution - describe an overall problem and how it is solved by explaining smaller problems and their solutions, and showing how they work together to solve the bigger issue
- cause and effect - topic is the overall cause/effect, describe the contributing causes and effects inside
- Pro and Con - analyze somethign in terms of desirability by showing its most important benefits and problems.
- compare and contrast - Compare two things by describing ways in which they are similar and different
- Opinion/persuasive - express an opinion and explain reasons why it should be accepted
