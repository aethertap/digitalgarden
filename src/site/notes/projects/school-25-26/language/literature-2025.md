# Literature and Discussion, 2025

We have a list of books to read. Each week, we'll try to get through about 75-100 pages and talk about what we read. 

- How does it connect to what we're learning in other classes?
- How could it provide inspiration for writing, game development, or service projects?
- How could this knowledge change the way people live in the future?
- What about these ideas is making you uncomfortable or challenging your worldview?
