# Marketing and publishing your stuff

We're going to start building a website for each of you, using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com).

Class goals:

- [ ] Build a website to host your portfolio of work
- [ ] Build a list of interested people (an email list for marketing and announcements)
- [ ] Use the website to market a product of your own creation
- [ ] Create regular content based on what we're doing in school and whatever you're interested in otherwise
    - [ ] The school stuff should be cherry-picked from the best projects and labs, to showcase your work
    - [ ] Other interesting stuff can be whatever you think is cool

- [ ] #hw Getting stated with [Astro](https://astro.build) - follow the tutorial to build a simple blog using the SoildJS integration. [[2025-09-08\|2025-09-08]]
