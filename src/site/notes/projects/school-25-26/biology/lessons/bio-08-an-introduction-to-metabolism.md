#  Chapter 8: Introduction to Metabolism

Focus on the big picture in this chapter. There is a lot of jargon and complex language, but the main idea is this:

The cell uses the free energy available from hydrolyzing ATP into ADP to drive chemical reactions that are otherwise not able to happen by themselves (like building complex molecules from simple parts). For reactions that would spontaneously occur except for their high activation energy, the cell has thousands of enzymes that grab the reactants and put them together properly so that the reaction can happen.  With these two processes active, the cell can locally reverse the trend of increasing entropy by consuming energy from outside and using it to build order on the inside.
