#  Chapter 9: Cellular Respiration and Fermentation

What's the important concept here?
- Cells "burn" food by gradually oxidizing it to release protons
- The protons are used to drive cellular machinery that synthesizes ATP
- ATP is like a rechargeable battery
- The cell starts with glucose, cuts it into a few pieces, then that becomes pyruvate.
    - That part of the process yields 2 ATP and 2 NADH
- Pyruvate is then oxidized and enters the citric acid cycle in the mitochondria
- The citric acid cycle yields one ATP per turn, going through several changes until it winds up with citric acid again
