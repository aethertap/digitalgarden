# Engineering curriculum 2025

Big ideas:
- Understanding CNC and g-code
- Design for buildability ([[projects/school-25-26/engineering/design-for-3d-printing\|design-for-3d-printing]], similar for cnc milling, etc)
- Parametric designs - what do you want to be able to tinker with?
- Construction and programming of a CNC machine 
- Design of accessories for existing tools (like a light, camera mount, and motorized stage for our microscope)
