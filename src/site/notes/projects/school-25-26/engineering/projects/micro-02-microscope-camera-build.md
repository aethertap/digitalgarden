## Topics outline


- Finding focal distance 
- Designing for adjustability 
- Remember the cables! 

## Lesson Content

Today we're going to rough-prototype the camera.

- We want to find the correct distance for it from the eyepiece for good focus
- We need to know if that distance ever changes, or if a more fixed-in-place build will work
- We need to see how to access the video stream from the rasbperry pi
    - Hopefully it's streamable over the network!

## Homework

- [ ] #hw (engr) Get the camera working on the raspberry pi, then measure where it needs to be in order to work with the microscope's focus controls.  [[2025-09-16\|2025-09-16]]
- [ ] #hw (engr) Create a model of the camera in onshape that we can use to design a mount.  [[2025-09-16\|2025-09-16]]
- [ ] #hw (engr) Read the section about screw threads and interference fits on [this article.](https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/#crush-ribs) 2025-09-16
