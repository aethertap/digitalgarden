# The World History Map

We will use QGIS to make a time-evolving map that puts a place and time on things we learn during history this year. 

## Process

As we study a period, we'll set the active time window in QGIS to cover the period we're currently in, so that we can see what else is happening in the world at that time. As events occur or things change, we'll either edit the shapes with a new version for the given time, or we'll add new stuff (or remove things that disappear).

Every history session should be driven by this project - we're studying in order to build up this map. The map is our final project, but it will also hopefully make this stuff stick in the brain better.

Each data item on the map should have the option to attach documents and images, and to keep a list of URLs relevant to whatever it is. The map itself needs to be under revision control and shared by each of us.
