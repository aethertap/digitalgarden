# History and Civics, 2025

We're finishing up modern world history this year, and focusing on American history in particular. In addition, we're going to blunder through civics again.

This time, I have some curriculum resources to help:

Complement this with Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast shows and CJ Killmer's Dangerous History podcast.

Class structure:
1. Presentation
2. Retrieval practice (quizzing and discussion)
3. Analysis (writing assignment)
4. Testing (periodic exams)

## Students Of History Curricula

These are designed to be used at a lesson a day pace. I'm not convinced yet that there's enough actual content to be worth it.
