# Creating your personal website

This year, you'll be building a website to showcase your work and to serve as an easy way to show people what we do in class. The site will be built with Astro and SoildJS.

- [astro web framework](https://astro.new/latest/)
- [SoildJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)

We're going to be using Astro as a "Static Site Generator" (SSG). That means that we're not going to have any code running on the server to generate stuff on the fly. Instead, we'll run all of the astro stuff ahead of time on our own laptops to create HTML for our site, then we'll send that plain HTML to vercel or netlify to host. Later, we might make some dynamic sites that have server functions, but for now we don't need it.


Your site needs to have a few different areas at the bare minimum:
- A "Curriculum Vitae" page that serves as an index to your best work and biggest achievements. You'll be updating this page frequently with new things you do.
- A gallery of photos and videos of artwork (if you want)
- A page of games you've made that can be either downloaded or played in the browser (if you want)
- A serial-release books section with links to your books (gr11)
- A project index with links to project pages
- A page for each project that has a main article, a blog-like journal for things you worked on, links to github repos for code, images, plans, etc.
