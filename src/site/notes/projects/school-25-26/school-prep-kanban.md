## Ready to start

- [ ] Fix my daily note template so that it's more of a dashboard and doesn't stuff my vault with duplicate data (use the MCL CSS snippets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYN4Nt7AuQk)
- [ ] Make a school calendar that includes all holidays, tests, homework assignments, and lesson plan links.
- [ ] Set the kids up with a personal domain name that they can keep with them forever. It needs to be non-juvenile.
- [ ] Configure a static-site generator to push content to the kids' domains based on their github accounts. Particular focus needs to go toward getting a *good* typesetting or blog formatting tool so that they can write quality documents.
    
    - [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) looks like a good one, using [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com) components.
- [ ] Get the CSS Multicolumn stuff set up for the kids


## In progress

- [ ] Make a lab outline for every biology lab that includes the required materials, estimated time, and whether it spans multiple days.
- [ ] Outline the engineering class content. This year's focus is on CNC, G-code, and building of machines.
- [ ] Skim the biology chapters and create a lesson outline for each chapter we will cover.
